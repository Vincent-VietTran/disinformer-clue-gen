1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,1,Movie,"Movie, Play, Novel",2,"Many informed clues are too generic and fail to specifically point to 'Movie' over 'Play' or 'Novel', thus not fulfilling their purpose of distinct specificity.
- Clue I1 ('A visual narrative unfolds through moving images, typically projected onto a large screen for audiences.') is excellent and highly specific to 'Movie' due to 'moving images' and 'projected onto a large screen'.
- Clue I2 ('Skilled professionals portray diverse characters, making a script's story real within a theatrical or cinematic setting.') has 'cinematic setting' which helps, but 'theatrical setting' makes it applicable to 'Play' as well.
- Clue I3 ('This combines various sound elements, including music and dialogue, crafting an immersive audible experience for viewers.') applies equally to 'Movie' and 'Play'.
- Clue I4 ('This theatrical element often involves a director's creative vision, guiding all artistic and dramatic aspects of the production.') uses 'theatrical element' which is broad, and 'director' applies to both 'Movie' and 'Play'.
- Clues I5, I6, I7, I8, I9 are all too generic. I5 ('Globally experienced, these captivating productions transport audiences to diverse worlds and imagined realities, offering immersive journeys.') applies to all choices. I6 ('A series of sequential scenes are carefully pieced together, forming a cohesive narrative. This structure tells a complete story.') applies to all choices. I7 ('Audiences frequently assemble in a specialized location to jointly observe this type of public entertainment.') applies to both 'Movie' (cinema) and 'Play' (theater). I8 ('This structured document guides a production, detailing character actions, dialogue, and speech for the entire performance.') applies to both 'Movie' (screenplay) and 'Play' (script). I9 ('It frequently explores intricate themes, significant societal issues, or grand fantastical adventures, presented via engaging narratives.') applies to all choices.
Overall, only one clue (I1) is truly specific, with one other (I2) offering a partial hint. The majority are not specific enough for 'informed' clues, making them less effective.",3,"The misinformed clues have mixed effectiveness in creating productive doubt while staying answer-related.
- Clue M1 ('To comprehend foreign language spoken, one might read subtitles, often improving and enriching the viewing experience considerably.') leans too heavily towards 'Movie'. While plays can have supertitles, 'subtitles' are predominantly associated with films, making it less ambiguous between 'Movie' and 'Play' and irrelevant for 'Novel'. It doesn't create sufficient doubt for its category.
- Clue M2 ('A brief dramatic performance might include elaborate costumes and intricate sets for a small audience.') is effective. 'Dramatic performance', 'elaborate costumes and intricate sets', and 'small audience' can apply to both indie films and small-scale theatrical productions, successfully creating ambiguity between 'Movie' and 'Play'.",5,"Both fake clues are excellent and highly effective at clearly misdirecting to the other answer choices, 'Novel' and 'Play', as intended.
- Clue F1 ('Bound printed pages contain stories readers interpret, engaging their own imaginative minds to create meaning.') clearly points to 'Novel' with phrases like 'bound printed pages' and 'readers interpret'.
- Clue F2 ('Live performers engage directly with an audience, bringing a written script to life on stage.') clearly points to 'Play' with phrases like 'live performers', 'directly with an audience', and 'on stage'.","Many informed clues (I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9) are too generic and fail to specifically distinguish 'Movie' from 'Play' or 'Novel', lacking the required specificity for 'informed' clues.; The 'extra clue' ('Its worldwide financial success is typically gauged by box office earnings and critical praise it receives.') is highly specific to 'Movie' ('box office earnings'). This clue should either be moved to the 'informed_clues' category to accurately reflect its strength or be rephrased if the intention was to avoid making the answer too obvious. Its presence as an extra clue, combined with its specificity, makes the game significantly easier by providing a very strong hint for the correct answer.",2,"The overall difficulty is easy (2/5). This is primarily due to the strong specificity of two clues for 'Movie': Informed Clue I1 ('moving images, typically projected onto a large screen') and especially the 'Extra Clue' E1 ('box office earnings'). These two clues are very direct and make 'Movie' the obvious answer, despite the excellent misdirection from the fake clues. The generic nature of many other informed clues does little to increase the challenge, as players will likely focus on the highly specific and unmistakable clues (I1 and E1).","The clue set demonstrates excellent length compliance for all clues and no answer contamination. The fake clues are exceptionally well-crafted, providing clear and effective misdirection to 'Novel' and 'Play'. However, the game's difficulty is significantly undermined by the specificity of key clues for 'Movie'. Informed Clue I1 is strong, but the 'Extra Clue' E1, with its explicit mention of 'box office earnings', makes the answer almost unmistakable, rendering the game too easy. Furthermore, a large number of the 'informed clues' are too generic, applying equally well to 'Play' or even 'Novel', which dilutes their effectiveness in guiding players to the correct answer specifically. The misinformed clues have mixed success, with M1 leaning too specific. To improve the game, more specific 'informed clues' (like I1) are needed, and the highly specific 'extra clue' should be re-evaluated for its placement or rephrased if a higher difficulty is desired. The generic informed clues should be made more distinct to enhance the challenge and ensure they fulfill their intended purpose.",14,14,100%,16.1

They describe unique plot points (e.g., diplomatic mission and trade dispute in clue 1, high-speed race in clue 2), specific characters/items (e.g., double-bladed weapon for Darth Maul in clue 4, amphibious Gungan species in clue 5), and core themes/events (e.g., chosen individual prophecy in clue 6, origins of a legendary hero in clue 8). These clues would be very effective in pointing players to the correct answer without being overly generic.",4,"Misinformed clues (0-1) effectively create ambiguity. Clue 0, describing a clandestine organization controlling information, could apply to the Trade Federation/Sith in Star Wars or the Bene Gesserit/Spacing Guild in Dune. Clue 1, mentioning ancient magical artifacts sought by rival factions, while less prominent in 'The Phantom Menace' specifically, could generally fit the Star Wars universe (e.g., Sith artifacts, holocrons) and certainly Dune (e.g., spice as a sought-after resource, prophecies, advanced tech). They are related to the answer's genre but vague enough to apply to multiple choices, fulfilling their purpose well.",5,"Fake clues (0-1) are highly effective at misdirection. Clue 0 specifically describes Luke Skywalker's journey in 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope', mentioning a 'young farmhand' and 'joining rebels against an evil empire'. Clue 1 perfectly describes Han Solo and Chewbacca, the 'rogue smuggler and his furry co-pilot', also characteristic of 'A New Hope'. These clues clearly point to a wrong answer choice, fulfilling their purpose with precision.","extra_clues[0] is highly specific to 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace' (Trade Federation, Battle Droids, Naboo occupation) and should have been categorized as an informed clue, not an extra clue. This indicates a miscategorization and reduces the overall strategic balance of the clue set, as it essentially adds another very strong informed clue.",2,"The difficulty is rated as 'easy' primarily due to the exceptional specificity and distinctiveness of both the informed and fake clues. The informed clues for 'The Phantom Menace' (e.g., podrace, double-bladed lightsaber, Gungans, trade dispute, chosen one prophecy) are extremely unique to that film, making it straightforward for a player familiar with Star Wars to identify the correct answer. Similarly, the fake clues for 'A New Hope' (farmhand joining rebels, rogue smuggler with furry co-pilot) are unequivocally specific to that film. This clear distinction between the two Star Wars choices, combined with only three overall choices, makes the identification process relatively simple. The misinformed clues, while creating general ambiguity for the sci-fi genre, do not sufficiently obscure the very strong pointers from the specific clues.","The clue set demonstrates excellent adherence to word count requirements, with all clues falling within the 15-20 word range. There is no answer contamination found within any of the clues. The informed clues are outstanding in their specificity and accuracy for 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'. The fake clues are equally strong, providing clear and effective misdirection to 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'. The misinformed clues successfully introduce ambiguity relevant to the broader sci-fi genre, applicable to both Star Wars and Dune. However, a significant issue is the miscategorization of 'extra_clues[0]', which is a highly specific informed clue for 'The Phantom Menace' and diminishes the intended strategic distribution of clue types. Due to the high specificity of the informed and fake clues, the overall difficulty for a player familiar with Star Wars would be easy.",14,14,100%,15.9
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,1,Song,"Poem, Short Film, Song",4,"The informed clues are generally strong and specific to 'Song'. Clues 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are excellent, providing distinct characteristics like lyrical poetry, structured sounds, harmony, rhythm, vocal/instrumental elements, memorization, and specific song structure (verses, choruses). Clue 3 ('Heard via radio, streaming, or live. This auditory experience captures and preserves moments in time.') is also very good, focusing on the medium and experience. Clue 7 ('Created by artists, this unique expression travels across all cultures and generations, effectively transcending language barriers.') and Clue 9 ('This auditory experience is crafted to move both body and soul through its compelling delivery.') are slightly more generic as they could also apply to instrumental music or other art forms, but in context, they still lean towards 'Song'. Overall, the majority are highly effective in pointing to the correct answer.",1,"The misinformed clues are poorly designed for their intended purpose of creating productive doubt while remaining related to 'Song'.
- Misinformed Clue 1 ('This presents dramatic narratives, following distinct characters as they undergo profound, significant personal transformations throughout their journey.') points very strongly to 'Short Film' or 'Poem' (especially narrative poems) rather than vaguely to 'Song'. While some songs tell stories, the emphasis on 'dramatic narratives,' 'distinct characters,' and 'profound transformations' is far more characteristic of film or literature than a typical song. It fails to create ambiguity for 'Song' and instead acts as a misdirection to other choices.
- Misinformed Clue 2 ('Often involves elaborate stage settings and costumes to visually enhance the emotional impact for audiences.') does not relate well to 'Song' at all. It points more towards theatrical performances (opera, musicals, plays) which are not among the choices. While a live concert might have 'stage settings,' 'costumes' are not inherent to a 'Song' itself, and 'stage settings' are distinct from 'film sets.' This clue fails to create any meaningful ambiguity for 'Song' among the given choices and introduces an irrelevant concept.",5,"Both fake clues are highly effective in clearly misdirecting to the other answer choices.
- Fake Clue 1 ('Bound pages filled with text tell intricate narratives, often requiring sustained reading for full comprehension.') perfectly describes a 'Poem' (or a book/novel, which 'Poem' is the closest fit among the choices).
- Fake Clue 2 ('Moving images projected on a screen create visual stories with actors portraying roles in various settings.') is an excellent and precise description of a 'Short Film'. Both clues successfully draw attention away from 'Song' and towards the incorrect options.",,2,"The difficulty is on the easier side (2/5) due to several factors. There is an overwhelming number of strong and specific informed clues (9 informed clues + 1 extra clue, making 10 clues total) that clearly point to 'Song'. The fake clues are also very effective in redirecting to the other choices. Crucially, the misinformed clues fail to create any genuine ambiguity for 'Song'; instead, they largely misdirect away from it or refer to irrelevant concepts, making it even easier to rule 'Song' in based on the sheer volume of accurate descriptions. The strong, numerous 'Song' clues, combined with ineffective misinformed clues, make identifying 'Song' relatively straightforward.","The clue set demonstrates excellent adherence to word count and strong performance in the 'informed' and 'fake' clue categories. The 'informed' clues provide a diverse and specific range of characteristics for 'Song', while the 'fake' clues effectively misdirect to 'Poem' and 'Short Film'. However, the 'misinformed' clues are a significant weakness. They fail to create productive doubt for 'Song' among the given choices and instead act as either poor misdirections to other choices or refer to concepts outside the provided options. This weakness in the misinformed clues, combined with the high number of strong informed clues, results in an overall easier game difficulty than intended for a disinformer game where ambiguity should be higher.",14,14,100%,15.9
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,2,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,"Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin, Hotel California - Eagles, Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen",5,"The informed clues are exceptionally strong and specific to 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Clue 4 ('Characters such as Galileo and Figaro are invoked') and Clue 2 ('protagonist confessing a grave deed and pleading for understanding from their mother') are almost direct references, making identification very easy. Clue 1, Clue 6, Clue 7, Clue 8, and Clue 9 further detail the song's unique structure, themes, and musical elements with precision, leaving little room for doubt. Clue 3 also points directly to key lyrical questions. Clue 5 is slightly more general but still accurately describes the song's musicality.",2,"The misinformed clues are less effective at creating productive doubt across the choices. Clue M1 ('A historical account of a famous astronomer's persecution...') attempts to leverage the 'Galileo' reference but distorts it into a factual historical account, which doesn't accurately apply to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' as a song, nor does it vaguely apply to the other song choices. This clue is more of a factual inaccuracy about 'Bohemian Rhapsody' than a vague clue designed to create ambiguity among the *song* choices. Clue M2 ('This theatrical production depicts a dramatic court trial where a character is judged for past misdeeds.') is slightly better as it relates to the themes of guilt and judgment in 'Bohemian Rhapsody' but exaggerates the 'trial' aspect. However, it doesn't effectively create ambiguity by applying vaguely to the other choices ('Stairway to Heaven' or 'Hotel California'), making its purpose of creating 'productive doubt' limited.",5,"The fake clues are outstanding. Clue F1 ('Features a long, intricate guitar solo and mystical lyrics about a spiritual journey towards enlightenment and self-discovery.') is a perfect description of 'Stairway to Heaven.' Clue F2 ('Explores a metaphorical place from which one can check in but never truly leave, with surreal imagery.') is an unmistakable reference to 'Hotel California.' Both clues are highly specific and accurately misdirect to the alternative choices.","Misinformed clues are not diverse in their ability to create ambiguity across multiple choices, with M1 being more of a factual misrepresentation than a vague clue, and M2 not applying broadly enough to other choices.",2,"The game is relatively easy due to the overwhelming specificity and number of informed clues. Clues like 'Galileo and Figaro are invoked' (C4) and 'protagonist confessing a grave deed and pleading for understanding from their mother' (C2) are almost direct identifiers for 'Bohemian Rhapsody.' While the fake clues are excellent at misdirection, the misinformed clues fail to generate significant ambiguity. The sheer volume (9) of highly specific informed clues, further supplemented by the strong 'extra clue', makes it straightforward to identify the correct answer, despite good fake clues.","The clue set is strong in its informed and fake clue categories, with the former providing exceptionally specific details that make the answer easily identifiable, and the latter offering precise misdirection for the alternative choices. However, the misinformed clues fall short of their intended purpose; they either misrepresent the answer (M1) or don't create sufficient ambiguity across the choices (M2), thereby failing to generate productive doubt.

- Informed clue 3: 'Readers can hold this physical object, turning each page to consume narrative at their own pace' clearly describes the physical interaction with a book.
- Informed clue 4: 'Often adapted to other media, its original, detailed version is always purely text-based and comprehensive' highlights a key difference from other media adaptations.
- Informed clue 5: 'This form of storytelling allows for intricate world-building and deep character development over many hundreds of pages' strongly points to the depth and length characteristic of books.
- Informed clue 6: 'Often found in libraries or bookstores, it serves as a vessel for knowledge and fictional tales' provides very specific location context.

- Misinformed clue 2: 'A compilation of thoughts and concepts, systematically arranged to offer insights into various intellectual domains.'

Misinformed clue M1 and Fake clue F2 both provide direct descriptions of Lasagna Bolognese. Similarly, Misinformed clue M2 and Fake clue F1 both provide direct descriptions of Sushi Rolls. This means two distinct clues are given for each wrong answer, and all four are very direct, which makes it too easy to identify and eliminate the incorrect choices.",1,"The game is too easy due to the structure and content of the misinformed and fake clues. Both misinformed clues (M1, M2) and both fake clues (F1, F2) function as direct, unambiguous descriptions of the *other two answer choices* (Lasagna Bolognese and Sushi Rolls). A player can easily identify Lasagna from M1 and F2, and Sushi from M2 and F1. With the two incorrect choices clearly identified and eliminated, 'Pizza Margherita' becomes the undeniable answer by process of elimination, without requiring the player to carefully weigh ambiguous clues against the informed ones. This bypasses the intended challenge of creating doubt.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, specific, diverse, and perfectly compliant with the length requirements. However, the game's overall design is significantly hampered by the misinformed and fake clue categories. The misinformed clues fail to adhere to their definition of creating 'productive doubt' related to the actual answer; instead, they act as additional, direct fake clues. This redundancy means the player receives two clear identifiers for each incorrect answer choice, trivializing the process of elimination and making the game far too easy. To improve, the misinformed clues should be re-designed to be genuinely vague or misleading about 'Pizza Margherita' itself, rather than directly pointing to the other choices.",14,14,100%,15.7

Clue 2 effectively distinguishes from plants (heterotrophy). Clue 4's mention of 'systems' leans towards animals. However, Clues 7 ('Plays a crucial role in ecosystems') and 8 ('Characterized by a diverse range of species') are too generic and apply equally well to plants and fungi, diluting the overall specificity of the informed set.",5,"Both Clue 1 ('distinct life cycles') and Clue 2 ('found in nearly every biome, forming symbiotic relationships') are excellent misinformed clues. They are factually true for 'animal' but are also broadly applicable to 'plant' and 'fungus', thus successfully creating ambiguity and productive doubt among the choices without being incorrect for the answer.",5,"Clue 1 ('Often anchored to a substrate, deriving essential nutrients directly from the soil or surrounding medium') is an excellent misdirection, strongly pointing towards plants and fungi, and clearly away from the typical animal. Clue 2 ('Capable of photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy') is a perfect fake clue, exclusively pointing to plants and definitively ruling out animals and fungi. Both clues effectively serve their purpose of misdirection.","Informed Clues 7 and 8 are too generic, applying to all choices, which reduces the overall specificity and diversity of the informed set.; The 'extra clue' ('Engages in respiration...') is essentially another misinformed clue, which while effective, might be redundant if distinct clue categories were strictly intended.",2,"Despite the presence of effective misinformed and fake clues, the informed clues provide several very strong and distinct indicators for 'animal'. Clues like 'nervous system' (Clue 9), 'metamorphosis' (Clue 6), 'specialized sensory organs' (Clue 5), and 'natural locomotion' (Clue 1) are highly specific to animals and quickly rule out 'plant' and 'fungus'. The fake clues are also very clear in pointing away from 'animal'. While the misinformed clues add some ambiguity, the cumulative weight of the specific informed clues makes the answer relatively easy to deduce.","The clue set demonstrates excellent adherence to length requirements and successfully avoids answer contamination. The misinformed and fake clues are particularly well-crafted, effectively creating ambiguity and misdirection respectively. However, the informed clue set is a mixed bag; while several clues (e.g., nervous system, metamorphosis, sensory organs) are outstanding in their specificity to 'animal', others are too generic (e.g., ecosystem role, diverse species), which somewhat dilutes the overall strength of the informed clues. The 'extra clue' functions as another misinformed clue. The strong, specific informed clues, coupled with clear fake clues, make the overall difficulty lean towards easy, as players can quickly identify key animal characteristics.",14,14,100%,16.1
7,Animal,African Elephant,2,African Elephant,"African Elephant, Blue Whale, Giraffe",5,"All 9 informed clues are exceptionally specific and accurate for the African Elephant, making them highly effective.

Neither applies to the African Elephant, making them highly effective in leading players away from the correct answer.",,2,"The game's difficulty leans towards easy due to the high number (9) of very specific and distinct informed clues. These clues provide an abundance of strong indicators for the African Elephant. Furthermore, the fake clues are exceptionally clear in pointing to the other two answer choices (Giraffe and Blue Whale), effectively eliminating them as possibilities. While the misinformed clues are well-designed to create ambiguity, the sheer volume and precision of the informed and fake clues reduce the overall challenge significantly, making it relatively straightforward to deduce the correct answer.","The clue set is very well-structured and compliant with all requirements. All clues meet the length criteria. There is no answer contamination. The informed clues are highly specific, the misinformed clues effectively create ambiguity, and the fake clues provide excellent misdirection.

Informed Clue 7 is good, highlighting the cultural aspect common to major sports. However, Informed Clue 1 ('excel in any competition') and Informed Clue 2 ('teams competing') suffer from answer contamination by using terms too close to 'competition', which is one of the choices. Informed Clue 2 is also too generic, as 'structured rules' and 'ultimate victory' apply broadly to games and competitions without a strong 'sport' specific element. Informed Clue 8 also contains 'competitors', but the strong context of 'professional leagues' makes it less problematic.",5,"Both Misinformed Clue 1 and Misinformed Clue 2 are highly effective.

The informed clues offer a good mix; some are very specific to 'sport' (e.g., Clues 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and the extra clue), while others (Clues 1, 2) are less specific or contain contamination, adding a subtle layer of challenge. The misinformed clues are highly effective at creating ambiguity across all three choices, which is crucial for a balanced game. Fake Clue 1 provides strong misdirection away from 'sport', helping players narrow down. Fake Clue 2 is less effective.

The misinformed clues are particularly well-crafted, effectively creating ambiguity across the choices ('game', 'competition', 'sport') without being irrelevant to the answer. Many informed clues are highly specific and effectively point to 'sport' (e.g., those mentioning 'athletes', 'specialized gear', 'physical prowess', 'professional leagues'). However, a significant area for improvement lies in the specificity of some informed clues; Clues 1, 2, and 8 contain terms ('competition', 'competing', 'competitors') that are too closely related to one of the other choices, diminishing their effectiveness in uniquely identifying 'sport'. Fake Clue 1 is outstanding in its misdirection, but Fake Clue 2 is weaker as it could still apply to a team sport.

Clue F1 uses 'shuttlecock' and 'high net' as unmistakable, definitive identifiers for Badminton, effectively ruling out Tennis. Clue F2 similarly uses 'hit a small rubber ball against a wall' as a clear and unambiguous descriptor for Squash.

The highly specific informed clues (I1, I3, I6) provide clear and unique indicators for Tennis (e.g., 'love' and 'deuce' scoring, 'clay, grass, or hard courts'), making the correct answer discoverable. However, this is expertly balanced by the excellent fake clues (F1 for Badminton, F2 for Squash) which offer compelling misdirection, and the misinformed clues (M1, M2) that effectively create ambiguity across all choices.
