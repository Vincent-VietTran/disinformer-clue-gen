They effectively describe the core elements of the genre from various angles, such as technology, future, space, ethics, and societal structures, all without hinting at Horror or Fantasy. The language is precise and descriptive.",4,"These clues create good ambiguity. The first misinformed clue about 'supernatural elements, jump scares, and psychological thrillers' strongly points to Horror, but the mention of 'terrify audiences' could subtly tie into some darker Sci-Fi themes if one stretches it. The second clue about 'mythical beings, magical systems, and momentous conflicts' clearly points to Fantasy, but the phrase 'environments of fantasy and imagination' could be loosely interpreted to include the imaginative worlds often built in Sci-Fi. They blend a partial truth (imagination) with a clear misdirection to other genres.",5,"The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue ('terrifying creatures, suspenseful plots, and a focus on the darker side of human nature') is a classic description of Horror and avoids any Sci-Fi elements. The second clue ('wizards, dragons, and quests in a world where magic and mythical beings exist') is a perfect description of Fantasy and completely excludes Sci-Fi. They are designed to strongly and plausibly describe the incorrect choices.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to make the correct answer clear to someone familiar with the genres. The misinformed clues provide just enough overlap or creative interpretation to make the player think, but not so much that it becomes confusing or impossible to deduce the correct answer. The fake clues are distinct enough not to cause confusion with the correct answer. This feels like a well-balanced difficulty.","The clues are well-crafted, with highly specific and non-contaminated informed clues. The misinformed clues offer productive ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect to incorrect choices. The difficulty is appropriate for a game.",14,14,100%,17.1

They effectively isolate 'The Matrix'.",4,"These clues are good. They start with a plausible but incorrect premise ('paranormal investigators', 'fellowship on a perilous quest') and then pivot to elements that *could* be vaguely associated with the correct answer if one wasn't paying close attention, but are clearly meant to point to the other choices.",5,"These clues are excellent. They directly and strongly describe the incorrect choices ('haunted house', 'powerful artifact') and are completely unrelated to the correct answer, providing strong misdirection.",,2,"The informed clues are so precise that the correct answer is very clear.

The ambiguity is present but not overwhelmingly strong.",5,The fake clues are designed to strongly point to the incorrect answers. 'The story centers on a determined individual facing personal obstacles while navigating a journey of self-discovery' plausibly describes 'Forrest Gump.' 'The film showcases a story of courage and resilience as a man fights to survive in a hostile environment' strongly points to 'Die Hard.' They are effectively deceptive and avoid any connection to 'The Hangover.',,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear.

This combination creates a moderate level of difficulty, where a player needs to carefully distinguish the specific plot points.","The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct descriptions of 'The Hangover' without any contamination.

The second clue strongly points to 'Indiana Jones' with its mention of a quest for hidden treasure and adventure, completely avoiding any connection to 'Mad Max: Fury Road'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively clear if one is familiar with the movie. However, the well-crafted misinformed and fake clues introduce enough plausible ambiguity to make it challenging enough for a game context, preventing it from being too easy.","The informed clues are precise and descriptive, effectively highlighting 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without contamination.

They cover various aspects like emotional depth, conflict, realism, and thematic exploration, providing distinct angles. No answer contamination detected.",4,"The misinformed clues effectively blend a partial truth (humor, amusement) with misdirection towards 'Comedy'. The mention of 'lighthearted stories' and 'funny moments' creates ambiguity, making it a productive confusion as it doesn't directly contradict the core of 'Drama' but steers away from its serious and intense aspects.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Romance' ('love, passion, emotional connections') and then pivot to 'Comedy' ('lighthearted narratives with humor, aiming to entertain and amuse'). They completely avoid any connection to 'Drama' and are highly deceptive.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer identifiable.

4,Movie,2,The Shawshank Redemption,"Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, Groundhog Day",5,"The clues are highly specific to the correct answer, avoiding any mention of the title or its direct synonyms. They focus on the core themes and plot elements without being overly vague. The variety of angles (hope, injustice, friendship, perseverance, freedom) is excellent.",4,"These clues effectively blend a partial truth (struggle, repetition) with misdirection. The first clue hints at a dramatic narrative, potentially leading to 'Titanic' due to the sinking ship element, while the second points towards 'Groundhog Day' with its focus on repetition. The ambiguity is productive.",5,"These clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first strongly describes 'Titanic' with love, loss, and a ship disaster. The second clearly points to 'Groundhog Day' with love and repetition.

The first clue about solving mysteries and uncovering truth could have a slight overlap with psychological thrillers, which are often adjacent to horror.

The second clue about dream explorers planting an idea is a clear and strong description of 'Inception'. They are completely unrelated to 'The Shining' and are designed to strongly pull the player towards the incorrect choices.,,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite apparent if one focuses on the details. The misinformed clues provide good distraction, but the overwhelming specificity of the informed clues likely makes the puzzle lean towards easier. It's not a 1 because the misinformed clues do require some careful consideration.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, providing precise and varied descriptions that directly lead to 'The Shining'.

The first clue about witty remarks, wordplay, and provoking laughter strongly points to Comedy. The second clue about dramatic conflict, emotional depth, and character development strongly points to Drama. Both are plausible descriptions of the incorrect choices and completely avoid any connection to the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear if one focuses on them.
