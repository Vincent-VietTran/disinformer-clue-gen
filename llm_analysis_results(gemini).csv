1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,1,movie,"movie, recipe, game",4,Good specificity. Avoids answer contamination. Distinct angles: visual storytelling and dramatization.,3,"Ambiguity is somewhat effective; 'tales of imagination' could apply to movies, but less strongly. Related to answer in that stories are often the basis of movies. Confusion is productive but could be stronger.",5,Points clearly to recipe and game. Avoids any connection to 'movie'. Believable as general descriptions of those concepts.,,3,"Just right; informed clues are specific enough, misinformed creates reasonable doubt, fake clues redirect effectively.",Good set of clues.

1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,2,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park",4,The informed clues are fairly specific and avoid direct answer contamination. Midi-chlorian count is a good distinct angle. The queen/trade blockade clue is also helpful.,3,"The misinformed clues are related to fantasy/adventure but are too generic. The ring clue is too specific to LOTR, and the wizardry clue is too specific to Harry Potter. They don't create enough productive ambiguity with the Star Wars choice.",4,The fake clues effectively point to Jurassic Park (dinosaurs) and Indiana Jones (treasure hunter). They clearly avoid referencing anything related to Star Wars.,,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are weak, making it moderately challenging to discern the correct answer.",The clues are generally well-structured. Strengthening the misinformed clues would enhance the difficulty and create more effective misdirection.,14,13,93%,17.5
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,1,Song,"Building, Song, Sport",4,"The informed clues are specific to musical composition elements like verses, choruses, and the blend of melody/rhythm/harmony. They avoid direct use of the word 'song'. They describe unique aspects of a song.",3,"The misinformed clues vaguely relate to 'Song' through the concept of storytelling, but are more readily associated with books or movies, creating some productive ambiguity by being related but misleading.",4,The fake clues directly point to 'Building' (structure for specific purposes) and 'Sport' (game played according to rules and competition). They are believable descriptions of the wrong choices and avoid any association with 'Song'.,,3,"The clues are well-balanced, making it neither too obvious nor too difficult to identify the correct answer. Informed clues are specific, while misinformed clues create ambiguity, and fake clues effectively misdirect.","The clues are well-structured to create a challenging but solvable disinformer game. The informed clues are distinct, misinformed clues are ambiguous, and fake clues are effective in misdirecting to the wrong choices.",14,14,100%,16.1
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,2,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,"Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin, Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen, Hotel California - The Eagles",4,"Specificity is good, avoids answer word well. Distinct angles on the song's musical structure and vocal complexity.",3,"Related to grandiosity/storytelling aspects of the song, but could apply to other epics. Ambiguity is decent, not too obvious.",4,"Effectively points to the other choices, highlighting ballad-like qualities or anthemic feel, contrasting with the correct answer.",,3,"3=just right. The informed clues are specific enough, but not giveaways. The misinformed and fake clues provide enough misdirection to make it challenging.","Good balance of clues that point to the correct answer without being too obvious, and misdirection that points away from it. Difficulty is moderate.",14,14,100%,18.1
3,Book,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,1,Book,"Book, Movie, Podcast",4,"The informed clues are specific and highlight the unique aspects of a book, such as the use of imagination and vivid descriptions, without using the word 'book'.",3,"The misinformed clues are related to storytelling and engagement, which could vaguely apply to all options, but the specific details about movement, sets, and costumes lean more towards 'Movie' than 'Book' or 'Podcast', so the ambiguity isn't perfect.",4,"The fake clues effectively point towards 'Movie' (visual medium, moving images) and 'Podcast' (audio entertainment, sound effects), while avoiding any connection to 'Book'.",,3,"The combination of informed, misinformed, and fake clues creates a balanced challenge. The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide sufficient misdirection to make the game interesting.","Overall, the clues are well-structured and designed to create a moderately challenging disinformer game. The informed clues are suitably specific, the misinformed clues provide some ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect towards the incorrect choices.",14,14,100%,15.9
3,Book,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,2,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, A Wrinkle in Time",4,"The informed clues are specific to the magical school and the protagonist's background, avoiding explicit mention of the title. They create a strong connection to the intended answer.",3,"The misinformed clues touch on themes of adventure and friendship, which are present in the correct answer, but are generic enough to apply to other children's stories, creating some ambiguity.",4,"The fake clues directly align with elements found in 'The Chronicles of Narnia' and 'A Wrinkle in Time,' effectively diverting attention from 'Harry Potter'.",,3,"The combination of specific informed clues, ambiguous misinformed clues, and targeted fake clues creates a moderate level of challenge.","The clues work together to create a reasonable level of difficulty. The informed clues are well-targeted, the misinformed clues provide productive ambiguity, and the fake clues actively mislead towards the incorrect options.",14,14,100%,16.9
4,TV Show,Breaking Bad,1,TV Show,"TV Show, Song, Book",4,"The informed clues are reasonably specific to episodic narratives and character development over time, which are strong aspects of TV shows. They avoid using the answer word directly and offer distinct angles.",3,"The misinformed clues relate to storytelling and information presentation, which could apply to all options to some extent, but they are slightly more aligned with books. The ambiguity is decent but could be stronger.",4,"The fake clues clearly point away from 'TV Show' and towards 'Song' and something more general (Theatre, but implying not book). They are believable red herrings.",,3,"The clues present a moderate challenge. Informed clues are helpful but not overly obvious, misinformed clues create some ambiguity, and fake clues offer clear misdirection. Requires some thought but is solvable.","The clues are generally well-constructed. The informed clues are solid, the misinformed clues could be slightly more ambiguous, and the fake clues effectively mislead. The difficulty is appropriate.",15,15,100%,17.0
4,TV Show,Breaking Bad,2,Breaking Bad,"The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire",4,"The informed clues are specific and well-crafted, avoiding direct mention of the answer. The cancer diagnosis and Albuquerque setting are strong identifiers. They could be slightly more diverse in their focus; both relate to plot/setting.",3,"The misinformed clues are reasonably ambiguous, relating to common tropes in TV dramas (friendship, survival). However, they could be more subtly connected to the specific choices to increase the effectiveness of the misdirection.",4,The fake clues effectively point to other types of shows. Miami police procedural is a good misdirect for The Sopranos (crime drama). British royal family is a good misdirect to none of these but is still generally well done.,,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide players to the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide enough distraction without being overly obvious.","Overall, the clues are well-structured and create a balanced challenge for the disinformer game.

No answer contamination. Distinct angle focusing on interactivity and player agency.",3,"The ambiguity is decent. 'Linear narratives' and 'passive viewing experience' could apply to poorly designed games, creating some confusion without directly pointing away from the correct answer. Could be stronger if it focused on aspects games *can* share with books or songs.",5,"The fake clues strongly point to books (turning pages, written storytelling) and songs (musical composition, melody, rhythm, harmony) respectively. They effectively avoid any association with video games.",,3,"Just right. The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, while the misinformed clues introduce some ambiguity and the fake clues effectively misdirect towards the incorrect choices.","Overall, a well-constructed set of clues.

5,Video Game,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,2,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, The Last of Us, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone",4,Good specificity; no answer contamination. The 'century-long slumber' is a particularly strong clue.,3,"The 'seven mystical artifacts' could apply to Zelda, but the 'technological overreach' leans away. 'Interstellar travel' is less related.",4,"The zombie apocalypse clearly points to 'The Last of Us', and the wizarding school to 'Harry Potter'.",,3,"Just right.

They avoid explicitly using the word 'food' and offer distinct angles relating to nutrition and preparation.",3,"The misinformed clues are somewhat related to food in the sense that clothing can be associated with identity and culture, similar to food. The ambiguity is reasonably effective, as it could potentially mislead someone to think about cultural significance in a broader sense. However, the link is a bit weak.",5,"The fake clues effectively point to 'Movie,' focusing on fictional worlds, narrative storytelling, and moving images. They clearly avoid any connection to 'Food' and are believable descriptions of movies.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues create sufficient distraction without being overly obvious. The link between clothing and food is weak, but the movie clues are strong.","Overall, the clues are well-structured.

The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide sufficient distraction.","Overall, the clues are well-structured. The informed clues are strong, the fake clues effectively misdirect, and the misinformed clues create some ambiguity, though they could be slightly improved for more effective confusion.",15,15,100%,17.2
7,Animal,African Elephant,1,Animal,"Animal, Plant, Mineral",4,"The informed clues are specific and distinct, highlighting behaviors and adaptations. They avoid using the word 'animal' directly. Good angles on what defines animals.",3,"The misinformed clues are related to animals but vague enough to potentially apply to other categories.

The ambiguity is reasonably effective.",5,"The fake clues clearly point to narratives (eliminating animal), and chemical compositions (pointing to mineral, eliminating animal). They effectively steer away from the correct answer and are believable in their respective contexts.",,3,"The informed clues are good, the misinformed clues offer some ambiguity, and the fake clues are strong. This creates a balanced challenge.","Overall, the clue set is well-constructed. The informed clues are specific, the misinformed clues create productive ambiguity, and the fake clues provide strong misdirection. The difficulty level is appropriate.",14,14,100%,18.1
7,Animal,African Elephant,2,African Elephant,"African Elephant, Giraffe, Zebra",4,"The informed clues are reasonably specific, focusing on infrasound and dust bathing. They avoid using the answer word directly. The infrasound clue is particularly strong, and the dust bathing is specific enough.",3,"The misinformed clues have some ambiguity. The 'habitat' clue could apply to other large mammals vaguely. The 'stripes' clue is more clearly misleading, but still related to animals in the same environment.",4,"The fake clues effectively point to giraffe and zebra respectively. They don't relate to elephants, and they are believable for the incorrect choices.",,3,The informed clues are helpful but not immediately obvious. The misinformed and fake clues provide some misdirection without being overly confusing.,"Overall, the clues are reasonably well-constructed. The informed clues are good, the misinformed provide some ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively point to the wrong answers. Difficulty is appropriate.",14,14,100%,18.4
8,Sport,Tennis,1,Sport,"Sport, Dance, Chess",4,"Good specificity in mentioning physical exertion, competition, and community. The second clue highlights health and social aspects, providing distinct angles. No answer contamination.",3,"The 'strategic' and 'risk-taking' elements relate to sport in a broad sense, but are more directly associated with Chess. Ambiguity is present but not very strong; it leans a bit too heavily toward Chess. Could be more vague to apply to all options more evenly.",4,"Clearly points to Dance with mentions of 'artistic expression', 'movement to music', and 'theaters'. Avoids mentioning any aspects related to Sport. Believable and effective misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are fairly direct, but the misinformed clue adds a layer of confusion. The fake clues are strong, making the player consider Dance seriously. Overall, a balanced difficulty.","A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are specific and helpful, the misinformed clue creates some ambiguity, and the fake clues are effective at misdirecting towards the wrong answer. The difficulty is appropriate.",14,14,100%,16.0
8,Sport,Tennis,2,Tennis,"Tennis, Golf, Soccer",4,Good specificity in mentioning racquet and net. Could be more distinct with details about scoring system. Avoids answer word well.,3,"Ambiguity is moderate. 'Strategic thinking' could apply broadly. 'Series of holes' points too strongly to golf. Related to the concept of sports strategy, but could be more subtly linked to tennis.",5,Clearly and effectively points to soccer with mentions of kicking and teamwork. Believable as a description of soccer.,,3,"Informed clues are specific enough, misinformed creates some ambiguity, and fake clues strongly misdirect. Just right.","Good overall structure. Informed and fake clues are strong. Misinformed could be improved to create more subtle confusion, perhaps focusing on aspects of tennis that overlap with golf (e.g., precision, individual skill).",14,14,100%,16.6
9,Country,Japan,1,Country,"Country, City, Continent",4,"The informed clues are specific and distinct, clearly pointing to the definition of a country. They avoid using the word 'country' itself. The mention of geographical borders, population, government, and international recognition are good indicators.",3,"The misinformed clues are related to the idea of a country in a very abstract way (e.g., 'understanding the physical universe' could be related to geography, or 'narrative structures' to national identity), but they are vague enough to apply to other choices like 'continent' or 'city' if one stretches the definition. The ambiguity is reasonably effective, creating some confusion without being completely random.",4,"The fake clues point towards activities or fields of study that are not directly related to the concept of a country, a city or a continent. 'Constructing buildings' and 'studying ancient civilizations' are related, but not directly, and therefore serve as good misdirection.",,3,"The clues require some understanding of the concept of a country but are not overly complex. The misinformed clues add a layer of ambiguity, making it not too easy.","Overall, the clues are well-structured and create a reasonable level of difficulty. The informed clues are strong, the misinformed clues create productive ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect.",14,14,100%,17.1
9,Country,Japan,2,Japan,"Japan, Brazil, Egypt",4,"Good specificity, no answer contamination. Distinct angles: tech innovation vs. cultural traditions.",3,"Ambiguity is decent. 'Flamenco' and 'music scene' are somewhat related to artistic expression, but not strongly tied to Japan. Could be more subtly connected.",5,Excellent misdirection. Carnival/football clearly points to Brazil. Pyramids/hieroglyphs clearly point to Egypt. No overlap with Japan.,,3,"The informed clues are specific enough, but the choices are distinct, making it not too hard. The misinformed clue adds a small amount of ambiguity, but the fakes are strong.","Overall, a well-structured disinformation game. The informed clues are good, the fake clues are excellent, and the misinformed clue is adequate but could be improved to create more productive ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.9
10,Historical Event,Moon Landing 1969,1,Historical Event,"Invention, Historical Event, Natural Disaster",4,"The informed clues are fairly specific to historical events, mentioning collective memory, shaping future generations, and scholarly analysis. They avoid using the term 'historical event' directly. A slightly more distinct angle could be explored.",3,"The misinformed clues are somewhat related to the idea of a historical event in that personal journeys and artistic expression *can* be influenced by them. However, they are a bit too vague and don't create a strong sense of productive confusion with the concept of a historical event. They lean more towards general human experiences.",4,"The fake clues do a good job of pointing away from 'Historical Event'. The 'imaginary tale' strongly suggests fiction, which contrasts with the factual nature of historical events. The 'routine occurrence' directly opposes the significance and impact associated with historical events. They are believable as descriptions of things that are *not* historical events.",,3,"The clues provide enough direction to make the game challenging but not overly difficult. The informed clues are fairly strong, while the misinformed ones could be refined for more effective ambiguity. The fake clues are effective in steering players away from the correct answer.","Overall, the clue set is reasonably well-constructed. The informed clues are decent, the misinformed could be improved for better ambiguity, and the fake clues are quite effective. The difficulty level is appropriate.",14,14,100%,16.4
10,Historical Event,Moon Landing 1969,2,Moon Landing 1969,"Moon Landing 1969, Challenger Disaster 1986, Chernobyl Disaster 1986",4,"The informed clues are reasonably specific without using the answer words. The mention of a 'national objective' and 'competition between superpowers' helps narrow it down, as does 'celestial body' and 'first steps'.",2,"The misinformed clues are not very effective. They are related to discovery and exploration, which has some connection to space exploration, but are quite generic and don't create much productive ambiguity. They are more distracting than confusing.",4,The fake clues effectively point away from the correct answer. The 'catastrophic natural event' and 'medical breakthrough' are clearly unrelated to the moon landing but could relate to the disasters.,,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are weak, making the overall difficulty moderate. The fake clues are effective in misdirecting.",The game is reasonably well-balanced. Improving the misinformed clues would enhance the challenge.,14,14,100%,16.7
