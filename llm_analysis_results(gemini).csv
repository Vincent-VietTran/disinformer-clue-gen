1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,1,Movie,"Movie, Novel, Video Game",4,"The informed clues are generally very strong and specific to 'Movie'. Clues #1 ('moving images and sound, often projected onto a large screen'), #3 ('cinematography, editing, and sound design'), #4 ('director's vision, crew and cast on set'), #5 ('purchase tickets for screenings'), and #8 ('reviewed by critics and nominated for awards') are particularly effective and highly distinctive. Clues #2 ('actors portraying characters in recorded scenes'), #6 ('short animated features to epic historical dramas'), and #9 ('iconic quotes and memorable scenes') are also good indicators. Clue #7, 'Dialogue, music, and special effects contribute significantly to the overall immersive experience,' is the least specific, as these elements are also central to video games, making it slightly weaker for distinguishing from other choices. No answer contamination was found (the word 'Movie' is not present).",5,"Both misinformed clues are excellent at creating productive ambiguity. Clue #1, 'Stories are presented in a sequential manner, designed to evoke strong emotional responses from an audience,' applies equally well to movies, novels, and video games, all of which tell sequential stories and aim for emotional impact. Clue #2, 'This medium often utilizes visual elements and narrative progression to engage its dedicated followers,' is also highly ambiguous, fitting all three choices (with novels creating visual elements in the reader's mind). They successfully create doubt as intended, without being entirely irrelevant to the answer.",5,"Both fake clues are perfectly designed for effective misdirection. Clue #1, 'Readers immerse themselves in written narratives, turning pages to follow characters through imaginative worlds,' clearly points to 'Novel' with specific terms like 'Readers,' 'written narratives,' and 'turning pages.' Clue #2, 'Players actively control characters, making choices that influence the unfolding plot and outcomes,' perfectly points to 'Video Game' with 'Players,' 'actively control characters,' and 'choices that influence the unfolding plot.' They are highly effective in diverting attention from the correct answer and towards the alternative choices.",,2,"The game leans towards being easy due to the high number (9) and strong specificity of the informed clues. Clues such as #1 (moving images, large screen), #3 (cinematography, editing, sound design), #4 (director's vision, crew, cast on set), #5 (tickets for screenings), and #8 (reviewed by critics, awards) are highly distinctive for 'Movie.' While the misinformed and fake clues are well-designed to create doubt and misdirection, the sheer volume and clarity of the informed clues make it relatively straightforward to identify the correct answer, especially for players with general knowledge of film. Reducing the number of informed clues or making a few more of them slightly less specific could increase the difficulty for future rounds.","The clue set demonstrates excellent content quality for both misinformed and fake clues, which perfectly fulfill their roles of creating ambiguity and clear misdirection, respectively. The informed clues are also generally strong and specific to the answer 'Movie.' However, the most significant issue is a widespread lack of length compliance. A large majority (11 out of 14) of the clues fall outside the 15-20 word requirement, predominantly being too short. This needs significant revision. Additionally, the overall difficulty of the game is rated as easy, primarily because the high number and distinctiveness of the informed clues make the correct answer readily apparent despite the well-crafted misdirection. No answer contamination was found, which is a positive aspect.",14,3,21%,13.5

They effectively distinguish the answer from other choices, e.g., the double-bladed weapon (Darth Maul), podracing, Midi-chlorians, and the Gungan outcast (Jar Jar Binks). They avoid generic descriptions and provide strong indicators for the correct answer. Informed clue #9 is the only one with a length issue (14 words).",5,"Both misinformed clues are excellent at creating productive doubt. Clue #1 ('An ancient prophecy hints...') applies well to the 'chosen one' theme of SW:E1 (Anakin) and also subtly to Paul Atreides in Dune, fulfilling its role of ambiguity. Clue #2 ('Indigenous populations struggle...') is particularly effective, applying strongly to SW:E1 (Naboo/Gungans vs. Trade Federation), Avatar (Na'vi vs. RDA), and also to Dune (Fremen vs. Harkonnens/Imperium). This clue is a perfect misinformer, creating significant doubt across multiple choices. Misinformed clue #2 has a length issue (13 words).",5,"Both fake clues are outstanding in their specificity and misdirection. Fake clue #1 ('A unique substance, crucial...') is an undeniable and precise description of Spice from Dune. Fake clue #2 ('Blue-skinned humanoids connect spiritually...') perfectly describes the Na'vi and their spiritual connection to Pandora in Avatar. These clues provide clear, unambiguous misdirection to the wrong choices, without ever naming the films. Fake clue #2 has a length issue (13 words).",,3,"The game's difficulty is 'just right'. The informed clues are very specific to 'The Phantom Menace', allowing knowledgeable players to identify the correct answer. However, the misinformed clues effectively sow doubt by applying to multiple choices, and the fake clues are exceptionally specific to the other answer options (Dune and Avatar), providing strong misdirection. This balance makes it challenging but fair, requiring careful consideration of all clues.","The clue set is of very high quality in terms of content and game design effectiveness. All clue types (informed, misinformed, fake) perfectly fulfill their intended purpose: informed clues are highly specific, misinformed clues create excellent ambiguity, and fake clues provide precise misdirection to the incorrect choices. There is no answer contamination, and the clue diversity is good, covering various aspects of the answer. The primary area for improvement is word count compliance; three clues fall below the 15-word minimum, which should be adjusted for consistency.",14,11,79%,15.1
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,1,song,"song, poem, short film",4,"Most informed clues are highly specific and effective in pointing to 'song'. Clues #1, #3, #5, #6, #7, and #9 are excellent, providing distinct characteristics of a song. Clue #2 is good but 'lyrical content' could also apply to 'poem'. Clues #4 ('Can evoke strong memories or set a particular mood...') and #8 ('Frequently becomes popular culture phenomena...') are less specific and could apply to 'poem' or 'short film' as well, slightly reducing their effectiveness in uniquely identifying 'song'. The 'extra_clue' is also an excellent informed clue.",1,"Both misinformed clues completely fail to meet the requirement of being 'related to actual answer BUT vague enough to apply to multiple choices (create productive doubt)'. Instead, they act as strong misdirections for 'short film'.
- misinformed_clues #1: 'Can be an extended narrative, exploring complex characters and intricate plot developments over time.' This describes a 'short film' or even a novel far more accurately than a 'song'. Songs are typically concise and do not feature extended narratives with complex plot developments.
- misinformed_clues #2: 'Sometimes involves visual storytelling, with dynamic scenes and compelling performances enhancing the experience.' This directly describes a 'short film'. While songs often have music videos, the clue frames the visual storytelling as central to 'the experience', which is not typically true for a 'song' itself.",5,"Both fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting to the other choices.
- fake_clues #1: Clearly and accurately describes a 'poem' ('A form of literary art where language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities, not just meaning.').
- fake_clues #2: Clearly and accurately describes a 'short film' ('A moving picture production with a brief running time, conveying a complete story or concept visually.').","Two informed clues (#4, #8) are somewhat generic and could apply to multiple choices, reducing their specificity for 'song'.; Both misinformed clues completely fail their intended purpose, acting as strong misdirections for 'short film' rather than creating productive doubt for 'song'. This reduces the diversity of clue types and makes the game harder in a potentially misleading way.",4,"The strong and specific informed clues (including the extra clue) make 'song' identifiable. However, the presence of excellent fake clues for both 'poem' and 'short film', combined with the misinformed clues *also* acting as strong fake clues for 'short film', creates a significant amount of misdirection. This effectively means there are 4 strong clues pointing to other options (2 fake + 2 misinformed acting as fake) against 8-9 strong informed clues. The misinformed clues' failure to create productive doubt for 'song' means they don't ambiguously help the player, but rather actively misdirect, increasing the game's difficulty by providing compelling reasons to choose an incorrect answer.","The clue set has significant issues with length compliance, with 10 out of 14 core clues being too short. Content-wise, the fake clues are excellent, providing clear misdirection. The informed clues are mostly strong and specific, though a couple are generic. The most critical issue lies with the misinformed clues; they completely fail their purpose by not relating vaguely to 'song' but instead serving as strong, direct descriptions for 'short film'. This imbalance in clue types and the misapplication of 'misinformed' clues will likely increase the difficulty for players in an unintended and potentially frustrating manner, as they are not ambiguous but simply incorrect for the answer while being correct for another choice. No clues contain the answer word 'song'.",14,4,29%,14.2
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,2,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,"Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen, Stairway to Heaven - Led Zeppelin, November Rain - Guns N' Roses",5,"All informed clues are exceptionally specific and accurately describe 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.
- informed_clues #1: Perfectly captures the distinct movements (ballad, operatic, hard rock).
- informed_clues #2: Directly references the iconic 'Mama, just killed a man' lyric.
- informed_clues #3: Highlights the song's signature complex, multi-tracked vocal harmonies.
- informed_clues #4: Accurately describes the crucial role of the guitar solo in connecting sections.
- informed_clues #5: Reflects the lyrical themes of confession, fate, and desperation.
- informed_clues #6: Explicitly points to the unique inclusion of operatic terms like 'Scaramouche, Fandango, Galileo'.
- informed_clues #7: Correctly identifies its pioneering status in music video history.
- informed_clues #8: Refers to the well-known intensive studio production and technical challenges.
- informed_clues #9: Clearly outlines the dramatic shifts in tempo and style that define the song's theatricality.
These clues are distinct and leave little doubt for a knowledgeable player.",4,"The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity while maintaining a tenuous connection to the actual answer.
- misinformed_clues #1: 'The storyline involves a character attempting to flee from a group of pursuing figures across various landscapes.' While not a direct narrative of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the chaotic operatic section could abstractly be interpreted as fleeing, creating productive doubt. It could also apply to metaphorical journeys in other songs like 'Stairway to Heaven'.
- misinformed_clues #2: 'Explores themes of personal transformation and the struggle against societal expectations in an unconventional manner.' This is very vague and can be loosely applied to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' ('I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me') as well as 'Stairway to Heaven' (spiritual journey, societal pressures) or 'November Rain' (struggle within a relationship, challenging norms). This vagueness is effective for misdirection.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting players towards the other choices, not the correct answer.
- fake_clues #1: 'A lengthy rock anthem featuring an iconic guitar intro and a slow build to an epic, emotional climax.' This strongly describes 'Stairway to Heaven' (iconic intro, slow build) and also fits 'November Rain' well, but does not describe 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which has distinct, sudden movements rather than a continuous 'slow build'.
- fake_clues #2: 'Known for its elaborate orchestral arrangements and a dramatic music video set during a wedding and funeral.' This is an almost perfect description of 'November Rain', which features orchestral elements and a famous music video depicting a wedding and funeral. It clearly does not apply to 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.",,2,"The round's difficulty is rated as easy (2) primarily due to the overwhelming strength and specificity of the informed clues. Many of these clues (e.g., operatic section, mother figure confession, layered vocal harmonies, nonsensical Italian operatic terms, groundbreaking music video) are nearly unmistakable identifiers for 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. While the misinformed and fake clues are well-crafted to introduce doubt and misdirection, the sheer volume and distinctiveness of the informed clues would allow a player with good musical knowledge to quickly and confidently identify the correct answer, making the challenge relatively low.","The clue set demonstrates excellent content quality across all categories, fulfilling the specific purpose of each clue type effectively. The informed clues are remarkably specific and diverse, highlighting unique facets of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The misinformed clues competently introduce ambiguity, and the fake clues provide strong misdirection towards the alternative choices. However, a significant flaw lies in the **length compliance**, with a substantial number of informed clues (6 out of 9) falling below the required 15-word minimum. This non-compliance is a critical issue that detracts from the overall quality score, despite the strong content. The overall difficulty of the round is easy due to the highly specific and numerous informed clues which quickly reveal the answer to a knowledgeable player.",14,8,57%,14.6

Clues #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, and #9 use highly distinctive language such as 'bound with pages,' 'paper sheets,' 'within its covers,' 'printed words,' 'sequential chapters,' and 'written works.' Clue #4 provides excellent contextual information ('libraries or personal collections'). Clue #7 describes a characteristic experience of reading, while clue #8 is the most generic but still accurate. Overall, they provide an abundance of clear indicators for the correct answer.",5,"Both misinformed clues are perfectly crafted to create ambiguity. Clue #1 uses broad terms like 'compelling story,' 'factual information,' and 'artistic expression' which apply equally well to 'Movie,' 'Book,' and 'Play.' Clue #2's description of being 'enjoyed individually or shared in groups' and 'sparking discussions' also fits all three choices, effectively creating productive doubt without being misleading.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective in their misdirection. Fake clue #1 unequivocally points to 'Movie' with specific descriptors like 'moving images and sound,' 'visual narrative,' and 'shared darkened space.' Fake clue #2 clearly describes a 'Play' using 'live performance,' 'actors portraying characters,' and 'on a stage.' Both clues successfully divert attention to the incorrect choices.","The 'extra_clues #1' is a highly specific clue for 'Book' ('Its pages are typically numbered, guiding you sequentially...'). While a strong clue, its classification as 'extra' rather than an 'informed clue' is a minor organizational issue, as it could have been integrated into the informed set. It also contributes to the length compliance issues.",2,"The difficulty is rated as easy (2) primarily due to the overwhelming number and specificity of the informed clues. With 9 strong informed clues (and an additional very strong 'extra' clue) directly pointing to 'Book' through unique physical and experiential attributes, the correct answer becomes apparent very quickly.

However, there are significant structural and functional issues. Two clues fall outside the word count compliance. More critically, the fake clues completely fail their purpose by pointing to works not listed as alternative choices, which severely undermines the game's misdirection component.

- Misinformed clue #1 ('A story about a struggling educator who discovers an unexpected talent for competitive cooking competitions.') is highly inaccurate. While 'struggling educator' has a faint link to Walter White, 'cooking competitions' is entirely false and does not create useful ambiguity or relate to 'Breaking Bad' in a meaningful, vague way. 
- Misinformed clue #2 ('It chronicles a scientist's journey to create a groundbreaking new energy source, facing ethical dilemmas.') is also significantly off-base. 'Scientist' is a stretch for a high school chemistry teacher in this context, and 'new energy source' is completely incorrect. 'Ethical dilemmas' is too generic to be productive.

However, the mention of a 'serial killer' is inaccurate for 'The Wire', which focuses on the drug trade, institutional failures, and systemic issues, not a serial killer plotline. Despite this minor inaccuracy, it still effectively misdirects away from 'Breaking Bad' and towards 'The Wire's' genre and setting.

This means there's no effective misdirection pulling players towards 'Elden Ring' or 'Horizon Zero Dawn'. The strong informed clues make it very simple to identify the correct answer for anyone familiar with the games.","The clue set has a mixed performance. Length compliance is fair, with 4 out of 14 clues being slightly outside the specified word count. The informed clues are the strongest aspect, with most being highly specific and effectively pointing to 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild'. However, one informed clue is too generic, and another has slight overlap risk. The misinformed clues are decent; one successfully creates broad ambiguity, but the other inadvertently eliminates one of the choices, reducing its effectiveness for the full set. The most significant weakness lies in the fake clues. Both fake clues completely fail their purpose by describing game genres that do not apply to any of the provided choices ('Elden Ring' or 'Horizon Zero Dawn'). This means they offer no meaningful misdirection or challenge. The extra clue is excellent and functions as another strong informed clue. Overall, the game would be relatively easy due to the strong, specific informed clues and the complete failure of the fake clues to provide any misdirection towards the incorrect options.",14,10,71%,15.1

However, `informed_clues #4` (life cycles), `informed_clues #8` (diversity in form, function, and habitat), and `informed_clues #9` (evolved unique characteristics) are slightly less specific, as these attributes can also apply to plants to some extent, reducing their distinctiveness, though still factually correct for animals. No answer contamination was found.",5,"Both misinformed clues are highly effective at creating productive doubt. `misinformed_clues #1` uses vague, almost anthropomorphic language ('distinct will and purpose') that can relate to animals but is also ambiguous enough to be considered for plants (e.g., growing towards light) or even natural phenomena. `misinformed_clues #2` refers to 'predictable patterns of behavior,' which is true for animals but also applies to plant growth, mineral formation, and chemical reactions, successfully creating ambiguity across all potential choices.",5,"The fake clues are perfectly designed for misdirection. `fake_clues #1` unequivocally describes 'plant' through its reference to photosynthesis and producing its own food. `fake_clues #2` clearly and distinctly describes 'mineral' by mentioning naturally occurring solid substances, rocks, earth, and crystalline structure.

With nine informed clues (plus an additional strong 'extra' clue), many of which highlight unique biological characteristics of animals (e.g., movement, heterotrophy, lack of cell walls, complex behaviors), players are given an overwhelming amount of direct information. While the misinformed and fake clues are well-crafted, the abundance of clear pointers to 'animal' significantly reduces the challenge, making the correct answer relatively straightforward to deduce for anyone with basic biological knowledge.","The clue set demonstrates strong understanding of the disinformer game mechanics, particularly in the effective crafting of misinformed and fake clues. The fake clues are excellent, providing clear misdirection. The misinformed clues successfully create productive doubt. The informed clues are mostly specific and accurate, though a few are slightly generic, reducing their distinctiveness. The primary areas for improvement are length compliance, as five clues fall outside the 15-20 word range, and balancing the number/specificity of informed clues to increase overall game difficulty. The 'extra clue' is a missed opportunity to either enhance the main informed set or replace a weaker one.

- #2 'Both sexes possess tusks' (true for African, not Asian). 
- #3 'enormous ears, shaped like the continent they inhabit' (a definitive characteristic of African elephants). 

However, a significant number of informed clues are generic and could apply to any elephant species, including the Asian Elephant or even the Woolly Mammoth (in a general sense):

- #5 'Matriarchal societies' 
- #6 'ecosystem engineers' 
- #7 'communicate using a wide range of vocalizations, including infrasound' 
- #8 'skin is typically grey and wrinkled' (Asian elephants also have grey, wrinkled skin). 
- #9 'face significant threats from poaching for ivory and habitat loss' (applies to both African and Asian elephants). 
- extra_clues #1 'consume vast quantities of vegetation daily'. 

While the strong clues are effective, the high number of generic clues dilutes the overall specificity of the 'informed' set, making it less distinct than ideal for a game where specific identification is key. This lowers the overall quality score for this category.",5,"Both misinformed clues are excellent at creating productive doubt and ambiguity. 
- #1 'Known for its impressive memory and intelligence, often seen in narratives about ancient, wise beasts' effectively applies to both African and Asian elephants, which are renowned for these traits. It also vaguely hints at 'ancient beasts' which could be interpreted by some as mammoths, adding to the ambiguity. 
- #2 'A truly majestic creature that has been revered in various cultures for its strength and gentle demeanor' also applies well to both African and Asian elephants. The term 'gentle demeanor' helps to subtly steer away from the extinct Woolly Mammoth, but the overall majestic and revered aspect still leaves room for interpretation. Both clues successfully avoid being too specific to any single choice while remaining relevant to the answer.",5,"The fake clues are perfectly crafted for effective misdirection.

The fake clues are extremely effective at eliminating two of the three choices (Asian Elephant and Woolly Mammoth) with very specific and unambiguous descriptions. Once these are eliminated, the player is left with the African Elephant.
