- `misinformed_clues #2` ('Often features a live performance element, where artists interact directly with a present audience.') points unequivocally to 'Play'. It does not create ambiguity for 'Movie'. 
These clues eliminate choices rather than creating doubt, making the game easier.",3,"The fake clues have mixed effectiveness:
- `fake_clues #1` ('Words printed on pages bound together tell stories across centuries and inspire human imagination deeply.') is excellent. It clearly and effectively misdirects to 'Book' and meets the length requirement.
- `fake_clues #2` ('A series of still images rapidly displayed creates an illusion of movement, often used for short narratives.') is ineffective as a fake clue for 'Book' or 'Play'. This clue describes animation or early cinematic techniques, which are closely related to 'Movie' rather than misdirecting to the other choices. It could confuse players or even inadvertently point towards the correct answer category.","Misinformed clues #1 and #2 are miscategorized; they function as clear fake clues for 'Book' and 'Play' respectively, rather than creating productive doubt related to 'Movie'.; Fake clue #2 is ineffective as it describes an aspect of visual media (animation/early film) which is not a clear misdirection to 'Book' or 'Play', and could even be interpreted as related to the correct answer.; Extra clue #1 is a strong informed clue that should have been placed in the 'informed_clues' category, making the correct answer more obvious if revealed.",2,"The round leans towards being easy. The informed clues are exceptionally strong and specific to 'Movie'. The misinformed clues, rather than creating ambiguity, act as highly effective fake clues, allowing players to easily eliminate 'Book' and 'Play'. The extra clue is also a very strong informed clue ('special effects and musical scores'), further solidifying 'Movie' as the answer if revealed. While `fake_clues #2` is poor, its ineffectiveness doesn't significantly increase difficulty as it doesn't strongly misdirect to a wrong answer, nor does it make the correct answer less clear. The overall clarity provided by the specific informed clues and the miscategorized misinformed clues makes the answer too straightforward.","This set of clues suffers from significant length compliance issues, with almost all clues falling below the minimum word count. Content-wise, the informed clues are of very high quality, providing specific and distinct descriptors for 'Movie'. However, the misinformed clues completely fail their purpose, acting as clear misdirections for 'Book' and 'Play' instead of creating ambiguity for 'Movie'. This miscategorization, along with the strong 'extra' clue, makes the round easier than intended. The fake clues are mixed, with one excellent clue for 'Book' and one ineffective clue that describes animation rather than misdirecting to the other choices.

*   Clue #4 ('performed live or recorded, reaching audiences globally') and #7 ('pass down traditions and historical narratives') are slightly less specific as they could broadly apply to plays or books (readings/lore), but in context with the other strong clues, they still point towards 'song'.
*   Clue #6 has a word count issue (14 words, outside 15-20). The phrase 'silently' is a bit confusing if it's meant to accompany dancing or celebrations, unless it implies internal reflection or silent appreciation. However, the rest of the clue points well to a song's function.

They are intended to be 'related to actual answer BUT vague enough to apply to multiple choices (create productive doubt)'. Instead, they function as additional fake clues that strongly misdirect to the other choices, without any meaningful relation or ambiguity concerning 'song'.
*   Misinformed clue #1 ('visual storytelling, characters and settings, narrative arc for viewers') unequivocally describes a 'play' or a 'book' (e.g., in visual adaptation). It has almost no direct relation to the core nature of a 'song' itself, and thus does not create productive doubt about 'song'.
*   Misinformed clue #2 ('can be read silently') is a direct and specific descriptor for a 'book' and has no plausible connection to a 'song' being 'read silently'.

While the informed clues are very strong and the fake clues are excellent at misdirection, the misinformed clues act as additional fake clues. By strongly pointing to 'book' and 'play' rather than creating productive doubt for 'song', they make it too straightforward to eliminate the incorrect choices. A player can easily identify that the misinformed clues, along with the fake clues, refer to 'book' or 'play', leaving 'song' as the obvious answer from the robust informed clues. This undermines the intended ambiguity and challenge.","This set of clues has significant strengths in its adherence to most word count requirements (only one minor deviation), complete absence of answer contamination, and the high quality of both informed and fake clues. The informed clues are specific and diverse, effectively guiding players toward 'song'. The fake clues are perfectly crafted for misdirection towards 'book' and 'play'.

However, the misinformed clues are a critical weakness. They completely fail their intended purpose of creating ambiguity related to the actual answer. Instead, they function as additional fake clues, strongly pointing to 'book' and 'play'. This flaw significantly reduces the game's difficulty, as it makes eliminating the incorrect choices too easy, thereby making the correct answer 'song' almost self-evident from the strong informed clues.

Clue #5, in particular, highlights its challenge to traditional radio formats. Clues #2 and #6 accurately delve into the lyrical themes of confession and internal struggle. Clue #7, while slightly more generic, still applies well. The clues effectively highlight what makes this song distinct from the other choices, providing highly specific identifiers. No answer contamination was found.",4,"The misinformed clues effectively create productive ambiguity. Clue #1, referring to a 'dramatic piece' with 'ensemble cast' and 'grand stage,' evokes the theatricality associated with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (or its stage adaptations) while remaining vague enough to apply to other dramatic works or be interpreted metaphorically for 'Stairway to Heaven' or 'Hotel California'. Clue #2, describing a 'character's journey' seeking 'redemption or escape,' is a very common lyrical theme that resonates with the internal struggle of 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' the allegorical journey in 'Stairway to Heaven,' and the trapped feeling in 'Hotel California.' This vagueness successfully generates doubt among the choices.",2,"The fake clues are ineffective for this specific set of choices. Fake clue #1 describes a 'protest anthem from the 1960s' and #2 describes a 'disco-era hit.' Neither 'Stairway to Heaven' nor 'Hotel California' (the other choices) fit these descriptions. Therefore, these clues do not 'clearly point to the OTHER answer choices' as required for effective misdirection. Instead, they act as generic red herrings that point away from *all* the provided choices, diminishing their strategic value in the game context.","Informed clues #2 and #6 are thematically similar, both focusing on the protagonist's internal struggle and lyrical themes of confession/regret.; Informed clues #1, #8, #9, and extra_clues #1 all heavily emphasize the song's unique multi-genre structure and operatic quality, which while accurate, could be slightly repetitive in their focus.; Fake clues do not target specific incorrect choices, making them less diverse in their misdirection strategy.",2,"The difficulty is rated as 'easy' primarily due to the exceptional specificity and distinctiveness of the informed clues. Many clues (e.g., #1, #3, #5, #8, #9) directly reference unique and defining characteristics of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (multi-movement, operatic section, radio format challenge, 'mini-opera' description). While the misinformed clues create some productive doubt, the fake clues are ineffective at misdirecting towards the actual incorrect choices. A player familiar with 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would find it relatively straightforward to identify from the strong informed clues, as the misdirection provided by the fake clues is non-existent for the given options.","The clue set demonstrates strong content quality for informed and misinformed clues but falls short on length compliance and fake clue effectiveness. Three clues are under the 15-word minimum, which needs correction. The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, offering highly specific and distinct descriptions of 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' making identification relatively easy for knowledgeable players. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by using vague descriptions that could apply to multiple choices while still resonating with the answer's general themes. However, the fake clues are a significant weakness; they do not misdirect towards the provided incorrect choices ('Stairway to Heaven,' 'Hotel California') but instead describe entirely different types of songs not among the options.

Clue #2 ('structured text') is also good. However, clues #5 ('share complex ideas and intricate plots'), #6 ('Many different genres exist'), and #7 ('Stories unfold linearly or non-linearly') are too generic and could easily apply to movies or audiobooks, diluting the specificity of the informed clues and reducing their overall effectiveness in distinguishing the answer.",2,"Misinformed clue #1 ('It can be listened to during commutes, narrating stories through compelling vocal performances') strongly points to 'audiobook' and does not create productive doubt about the physical 'book'. Instead, it acts as a direct misdirection to a specific alternative choice, which is the intended role of a fake clue, not a misinformed one for the primary answer. A physical book cannot be 'listened to.' Misinformed clue #2 ('Often displayed on a pedestal in museums, showcasing ancient texts or historical documents prominently') is better, as a physical book can indeed be displayed in a museum, but the phrasing creates some ambiguity, as visual displays (movies) or audio guides (audiobooks) could also be present in a museum setting.",2,"Fake clue #1 ('Moving images and sound create immersive experiences, transporting viewers into fictional or real events') is excellent and clearly points to 'movie,' one of the other answer choices. However, fake clue #2 ('Performers on a stage enact dramatic scenes, telling stories live for an immediate audience's enjoyment') fails its purpose entirely.

While there are significant issues with the misinformed and fake clues (e.g., misinformed #1 acting as a direct fake for 'audiobook,' and fake #2 pointing to an irrelevant option), the strength and quantity of the clues correctly identifying the answer largely negate the intended misdirection, making the solution straightforward.","The clue set has significant issues with word count compliance, as almost all clues fall short of the 15-20 word requirement.
