'Often features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' could apply to Horror and to some extent Fantasy. 'It often involves fantastical elements and imaginative creatures in a world that feels very unreal' could apply to Fantasy and potentially Sci-Fi if interpreted broadly (e.g., alien life). They are true for the correct answer but also plausibly true for at least one incorrect answer.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. 'Jump scares and intense sound design' is a hallmark of Horror, and 'mythical creatures, magic spells, and epic quests' are defining characteristics of Fantasy. Neither clue has any direct relevance to Sci-Fi.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear. The misinformed clues offer some plausible but not definitive alternatives, and the fake clues are strong misdirections to the incorrect answers. This balance makes for a moderately challenging game.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely target Sci-Fi without overlap. The misinformed clues provide a good level of ambiguity, and the fake clues are highly effective at misdirection. The difficulty is well-balanced.",15,15,100%,17.5
1,Movie,2,The Matrix,"The Conjuring, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'bullet time,' 'digital construct,' and 'sentient machines' which are directly and uniquely associated with 'The Matrix.' They effectively pinpoint the correct answer without being overly technical or obscure.",3,"The clues are too general. While factually true for 'The Matrix,' they are also broadly applicable to many popular action or sci-fi films. For instance, 'many exciting scenes' and 'a lot of special effects' could easily apply to 'The Lord of the Rings' or even 'The Conjuring' in terms of audience engagement and technical execution, creating a plausible but not strongly misleading ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue ('family terrorized by a malevolent entity') is a textbook description of 'The Conjuring,' and the second ('fellowship's quest to destroy a powerful artifact') is a perfect summary of 'The Lord of the Rings.' They strongly point away from 'The Matrix' without any overlap.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The 'informed' clues are quite strong, making the correct answer identifiable for someone familiar with the film. However, the 'misinformed' clues are vague enough to create some initial doubt, and the 'fake' clues are very strong distractors, requiring careful consideration of the details in the 'informed' clues.",The informed clues are highly effective and specific to the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too general and lack the productive ambiguity needed to truly challenge the player. The fake clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to the incorrect options.

They cover various aspects like dialogue, situations, characters, and the overall goal of entertainment through humor.",3,"The clues are factually true for 'Comedy' but are general enough to also apply to 'Drama' (complex human emotions, relationships, character development, conflict). They don't strongly apply to 'Action', but the shared trait of 'complex narratives' and 'keeping audiences invested' could vaguely link. The ambiguity is moderate.",5,"The first fake clue is a perfect description of 'Action' with its focus on chases, explosions, and fights, strongly misdirecting away from 'Comedy'. The second fake clue, focusing on human relationships and societal issues, is a strong descriptor for 'Drama', also effectively misdirecting.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if understood. However, the misinformed clues are general enough that a player might overthink them, and the fake clues are highly specific to the incorrect options, creating a balanced challenge.","The 'informed' clues are excellent, providing clear, specific, and non-contaminating descriptions of 'Comedy'. The 'fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Action' and 'Drama'. The 'misinformed' clues are moderately ambiguous, being true for both 'Comedy' and 'Drama', which is the desired level of vagueness.",14,14,100%,16.2
2,Movie,2,The Hangover,"Die Hard, The Hangover, Forrest Gump",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'The Hangover' without using any forbidden words. They highlight unique plot points like the missing groom, amnesia, the tiger, missing tooth, and baby, as well as the Vegas setting. They effectively differentiate the correct answer from the others.",1,"These clues are far too vague and do not apply to 'The Hangover' at all. They seem to describe a generic journey or self-discovery narrative, which is completely unrelated to the correct answer. They fail the critical requirement of being factually true for the correct answer.",5,"These clues are excellent fake clues. They strongly point towards 'Forrest Gump' without mentioning it directly, by focusing on a 'journey of self-discovery,' 'encountering various challenges and triumphs,' and 'personal reflection.' They are completely unrelated to 'The Hangover' and effectively misdirect.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer easy to identify if one is familiar with the movie. However, the fake clues are also very convincing for 'Forrest Gump,' which could lead to some deliberation. The misinformed clues are so poor they don't really contribute to difficulty.",The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer. The fake clues are also very well-crafted to misdirect towards 'Forrest Gump.'

The language is descriptive and avoids answer contamination.",3,"These clues are somewhat ambiguous. 'High stakes and suspense' can apply to Action, Thriller, and even some Adventures. 'Hero or protagonist facing difficult challenges and circumstances that are threatening' is also very general and could apply to all three. The ambiguity is productive, as it could lead a player to consider 'Thriller' or 'Adventure' based on perceived overlap in 'suspense' or 'challenges'.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection.

'Complex plot that explores characters' inner struggles and motivations' also leans heavily towards 'Thriller' or potentially a character-driven 'Adventure', effectively steering players away from 'Action'.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong, making 'Action' quite identifiable. However, the 'Misinformed' clues provide just enough overlap with 'Thriller' and 'Adventure' to prevent it from being a completely trivial identification.

The second clue is a perfect description of 'Indiana Jones', making it a very strong misdirection away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable. However, the misinformed clues provide enough ambiguity and the fake clues are targeted enough at the incorrect answers to prevent it from being too easy.

They effectively isolate the correct answer.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. 'The narrative explores the complexities of human relationships and the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment' could apply to many films, but it's not specific enough to plausibly point to 'Titanic' or 'Groundhog Day' in a way that creates confusion with 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Similarly, 'The story focuses on a central relationship that is tested by external forces and personal challenges' is also overly broad.",5,The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('The film centers on a love story complicated by social expectations and family disapproval of two people.') strongly points to 'Titanic' without any overlap with 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The second clue ('The plot revolves around a tragic event leading to the loss of a ship and many lives lost at sea.') is a perfect descriptor for 'Titanic' and completely misdirects away from the correct answer.,,3,"The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer.

They focus on isolation, psychological decay, paranormal activity, and specific iconic imagery in a descriptive manner.",3,"These clues are factually true for The Shining but are also general enough to apply to other suspenseful narratives. They create a baseline level of ambiguity. The first clue about 'extraordinary circumstances and dangerous situations' could apply to Inception's heist or Alien's survival. The second clue about 'mystery, suspense, and unexpected plot twists' is very broad and fits all three options to some degree.",5,The first fake clue strongly points to Inception with 'intricate dream sequences' and 'subconscious'. The second fake clue clearly describes Alien with 'space travelers' and 'hostile extraterrestrial life form'. Both are highly effective misdirections.,,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to strongly suggest The Shining, but the misinformed clues provide enough overlap with the other options to prevent it from being too easy. The fake clues are very strong diversions, increasing the challenge.","A well-balanced set of clues. The informed clues are precise and descriptive.

The ambiguity is present but could be stronger to truly mislead.",5,"The first fake clue perfectly describes Comedy. The second fake clue strongly points towards Drama, making them effective misdirections.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, and the fake clues are very clear misdirections. The misinformed clues are the weakest point, offering some ambiguity but not as much as ideal. This balance leads to a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent.

The first clue strongly points to 'The Notebook' by mentioning 'war' and 'perilous circumstances'.
