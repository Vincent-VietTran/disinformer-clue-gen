1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,1,movie,"novel, concert, movie",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'visual narrative', 'moving images', 'cinematic production', and 'screen' which all strongly point to 'movie' without using the word itself or direct synonyms. They highlight the auditory and visual aspects, storytelling, and the medium of display.",4,"These clues effectively create ambiguity. The first clue, 'It's a written work, often bound between covers, that transports readers to different worlds and eras with words,' shares the 'storytelling' and 'transporting readers' aspects with movies but misdirects towards 'novel' with 'written work' and 'bound between covers'. The second clue, 'It’s a performance art form where actors use movement and expression to convey stories on a stage, live,' connects through 'actors', 'convey stories', and 'performance' but misdirects towards 'concert' (or a play, which isn't an option but shares stage performance) with 'on a stage, live'.",5,"These clues are excellent for misdirection. 'It's an event where people gather to listen to live performances of musical pieces by various bands and singers' perfectly describes a 'concert' and has no connection to 'movie'. 'It's a collection of songs organized into an album, meant for continuous listening, by an artist or a band' also strongly points to music (and by extension, could be associated with a concert) and is entirely unrelated to 'movie'.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players towards the correct answer without being too obvious. The misinformed clues provide just enough overlap to create productive confusion, and the fake clues are strong misdirections to the incorrect choices. This balance makes for a well-rounded difficulty.","The clues are well-crafted for the Disinformer game. The informed clues are precise, the misinformed clues offer good ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively steer players away from the correct answer towards specific incorrect choices. The criteria for each category have been met.",14,14,100%,17.4
1,Movie,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,2,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Avengers: Endgame",5,"Clues are specific and creative, avoiding direct terms. They highlight key plot points like the trade dispute, young hero, space battles, and political intrigue without revealing the title. The diversity of angles covered (plot, character, setting, themes) is excellent.",4,"The misinformed clues are good. They touch on 'rescue attempt' and 'rebels fighting an oppressive empire,' which have thematic resonance with Star Wars in general, but are more directly applicable to other entries in the saga or even other franchises, creating productive ambiguity. They maintain a connection to the 'space opera' genre without being too specific to Episode I.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. 'A group of friends goes on a thrilling adventure, navigating treacherous landscapes and facing dangerous creatures' strongly points to 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'. 'A story of a man who goes to the underworld to seek revenge on the ones who ruined his family' could also be interpreted as a fantasy/epic quest, though less directly than the first. Neither has any connection to 'The Phantom Menace'.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to narrow down the choices effectively for someone familiar with the Star Wars universe, but general enough to require some thought. The misinformed and fake clues add a layer of challenge by creating plausible, but ultimately incorrect, paths. This balance makes it a 'just right' difficulty.","This set of clues is very well-constructed. The informed clues are specific and well-paraphrased. The misinformed clues offer a good level of plausible misdirection, and the fake clues are highly effective at pointing towards incorrect answers without any overlap with the correct one. The overall quality and balance of the clues are excellent.",14,14,100%,18.3
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,1,song,"novel, movie, song",5,"The clues are specific and use varied language to describe the essence of a song without using the word 'song' or direct synonyms. They cover aspects like structure, purpose, and performance.",4,"The misinformed clues effectively use partial truths. 'Displayed on pages' and 'found in libraries or bookstores' strongly point to 'novel'. The clue about 'visual art form' and 'moving images' points to 'movie'. There's a subtle connection to 'song' through the idea of 'conveying ideas' and 'telling a story', but the primary misdirection is strong.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue perfectly describes a 'novel', and the second perfectly describes a 'movie'. Neither has any overlap with 'song'.",,3,"The informed clues are clear enough to guide a player towards the correct answer with careful consideration, while the misinformed and fake clues provide sufficient misdirection to make it challenging.","The set of clues is well-balanced. The informed clues are descriptive and avoid direct terminology. The misinformed clues offer plausible but ultimately incorrect interpretations, and the fake clues decisively lead players to the wrong answers without touching upon the correct one.",14,14,100%,16.9
2,Song,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,2,Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen,"Yesterday - The Beatles, Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen, Hotel California - Eagles",4,"The clues effectively describe the unique structure and musical elements of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without using direct keywords. They highlight the operatic passages, hard rock climax, complex harmonies, varied styles, innovative structure, and blend of genres. The clues are specific enough to point strongly to the correct answer.",3,"The misinformed clues create some ambiguity. The first clue about 'treasure' is completely unrelated to any of the choices. The second clue about a 'repetitive chorus and simple verses' is misleading as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is known for its complexity, not simplicity. However, 'Hotel California' and 'Yesterday' have more straightforward structures and choruses, so it could lead to confusion, but not strongly enough to be highly productive.",5,"The fake clues are effective. The first clue about 'unwavering love' and 'enduring romance' strongly points to 'Yesterday' by The Beatles, which is a well-known love song. The second clue about a 'high-energy anthem about never giving up' could plausibly apply to 'Hotel California' (though not its primary theme) or even 'Bohemian Rhapsody' in its rock sections, but it's more aligned with a general anthem feel that 'Yesterday' lacks. The key is that they steer away from the specific operatic and structural elements of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, but the complexity of the song's description prevents it from being too easy. The misinformed and fake clues add a layer of misdirection that requires careful consideration of the options.","The informed clues are strong and descriptive, accurately capturing the essence of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without revealing the answer. The fake clues effectively misdirect to other options, particularly 'Yesterday'. The misinformed clues could be slightly improved for more productive ambiguity, but overall, the set is well-balanced.",14,14,100%,16.7
3,Book,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,1,book,"movie, play, book",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, directly pointing to the concept of a book without using the word itself or its direct synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like pages, stories, knowledge, and the act of reading, offering distinct angles.",4,"These clues create productive ambiguity. The first clue about 'moving images paired with accompanying sound' strongly suggests 'movie' but could technically apply to an audiobook with narration, creating a subtle connection to 'book'. The second clue about 'performers acting on a stage' clearly points to 'play' but a play is based on a script, which is a type of book, offering a tangential link.",5,"These clues are excellent fake clues. The first clue 'recorded piece of music' is a perfect fit for a separate, unlisted answer choice like 'album' or 'song' but has no relation to 'book', 'movie', or 'play'. The second clue 'visual form of art utilizes photographic methods' is a direct and strong misdirection towards 'photograph' or 'painting', neither of which are choices, but effectively steer away from 'book'. Since there are no other choices provided in the prompt, I've assumed these would be for hypothetical choices.",,3,"The informed clues are well-crafted to be challenging but solvable. The misinformed clues introduce ambiguity that requires careful consideration. The fake clues are designed to be highly misleading, but the overall balance makes it a medium difficulty game.","The informed clues are excellent and directly target the answer 'book' without using forbidden words. The misinformed clues offer good ambiguity, with subtle connections to the correct answer while clearly pointing to other choices. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to other potential, unlisted answer categories.",14,14,100%,16.6
3,Book,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,2,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"The Hobbit, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Eragon",5,"The informed clues are excellent. They consistently focus on the core elements of a young orphan discovering he's a wizard and attending a magical school, without using forbidden words. They highlight friendship, destiny, and the school setting from various descriptive angles, making them specific and clear without being overly direct. No answer contamination.",4,"The misinformed clues are good. 'The narrative focuses on a group of adventurers embarking on a perilous quest for a powerful artifact' has a thematic overlap with fantasy quests but misdirects towards 'The Hobbit' or 'Eragon' due to the 'adventurers' and 'artifact' phrasing. 'The story follows a young hero's rise to power, battling against forces of darkness in a medieval setting' strongly aligns with 'Eragon' and could also vaguely fit 'The Hobbit', creating productive ambiguity. They maintain a conceptual connection while subtly misdirecting.",5,"The fake clues are very effective. 'A tale of a dystopian future where society is controlled by technology and oppressive regimes' has absolutely no connection to any of the provided choices and is a complete red herring. 'This story involves a group of friends who go on an epic adventure to find a hidden treasure' strongly points to 'The Hobbit' or potentially 'Eragon' but has no link to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', making it a strong misdirection to incorrect answers.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide plausible but incorrect directions, creating a balanced challenge. Players need to discern the specific elements of the informed clues from the broader fantasy tropes in the other categories.","This is a well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are precise and avoid forbidden terms, effectively pointing to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'. The misinformed clues leverage thematic overlaps to create ambiguity, and the fake clues are strong misdirections to incorrect options without touching the correct answer. The difficulty is appropriately balanced.",14,14,100%,16.5
4,TV Show,Breaking Bad,1,TV Show,"Movie, TV Show, Documentary",4,The clues are specific and avoid direct synonyms or the answer word. They describe the serialized nature and broadcast/streaming aspect well. Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other.,3,"The misinformed clues attempt to create ambiguity by mentioning 'single sitting' and 'self-contained story,' which are characteristic of movies, but they don't strongly connect to the 'TV Show' answer itself beyond a general 'form of entertainment' or 'visual art' connection. The connection is a bit weak.",5,The fake clues are excellent. They clearly describe 'theater' and 'short videos/social media' which are distinct from 'TV Show' and have no overlap.,,3,"The informed clues are clear enough to guide players towards the correct answer without being too obvious. The misinformed clues offer some plausible, but ultimately incorrect, paths. The fake clues effectively pull players away from the correct answer.",The informed clues are strong and descriptive. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting. The misinformed clues could be slightly stronger in their connection to the correct answer while still misdirecting.,14,14,100%,16.9
4,TV Show,Breaking Bad,2,Breaking Bad,"Ozark, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul",5,"The clues are highly specific to Breaking Bad, detailing the protagonist's transformation, setting, moral themes, and descent into crime. They avoid using direct keywords and offer a comprehensive picture of the show's essence.",4,"The misinformed clues create ambiguity by touching on common themes like 'friends navigating college life' (though not directly applicable, could be a vague association for some shows) and 'lawyer solving legal cases' (a partial nod to Saul Goodman's role). This provides a plausible but incorrect direction.",5,"The fake clues are excellent misdirections. 'A group of friends navigates the challenges of high school and adolescence' strongly points to a generic teen drama, and 'A family works together to overcome obstacles and build a successful business' could easily be misinterpreted as a show like Ozark or a family drama, completely bypassing the core elements of Breaking Bad.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to strongly suggest Breaking Bad, while the misinformed and fake clues provide plausible alternative interpretations that require careful consideration, making it a balanced challenge.","The set of clues effectively balances specificity for the correct answer with believable misdirection for incorrect choices. The informed clues are excellent, and the fake clues strongly target the incorrect options. The misinformed clues offer a good level of ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.0
5,Video Game,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,1,video game,"movie, video game, stage play",5,"The clues are excellent. They use descriptive language that directly relates to the interactive and digital nature of video games without using the forbidden words or their direct synonyms. Each clue offers a slightly different facet of the concept, such as player agency, narrative advancement, simulated environments, and electronic devices. They are clear and specific to the answer.",4,"The misinformed clues are well-crafted. The first clue ('A complex form of art where creators design elaborate stages and choreograph performances for audiences to enjoy.') strongly points towards 'stage play' by mentioning stages and performances, but the 'audiences to enjoy' could also loosely apply to video games. The second clue ('Interactive stories told through animated sequences and voice acting, often released in episodic formats for viewers.') has a strong connection to 'movie' with 'animated sequences' and 'episodic formats for viewers,' but 'interactive stories' is a key element of video games, creating productive ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are very effective. 'A physical activity where competitors engage in athletic contests, aiming to achieve specific goals or win prizes.' clearly describes a sport, which is not among the choices, but it's a plausible misdirection if someone is thinking broadly about competitive activities. 'A form of artistic expression using moving images and sound to tell stories, often shown in theaters.' is a perfect description of a 'movie' and has no overlap with 'video game' or 'stage play', making it a strong misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, but the language is sophisticated enough to require some thought. The misinformed clues introduce plausible confusion, and the fake clues effectively distract towards incorrect options. This balance provides a good level of challenge.",The clue set is very strong.

'Ancient technology and mystical creatures' is a strong hint. 'Stamina system' is very specific. 'Freedom of exploration' and 'approach objectives in any order' are also strong pointers. The only minor point is that some clues could apply to other open-world games, but the combination is strong. No answer contamination.",3,"The misinformed clues create some ambiguity. 'Futuristic space exploration' could vaguely tie to the ancient technology aspect of BotW if interpreted very broadly, but it strongly points to Horizon. 'Team of soldiers fighting against alien invaders' also leans heavily towards Horizon, but the 'post-apocalyptic' aspect could be a very loose fit for BotW's ruined Hyrule. The connection to BotW is weak but present enough to cause slight confusion.",5,"These clues effectively misdirect to Horizon Zero Dawn ('futuristic space exploration', 'ancient technology' if misinterpreted, and the general idea of a technologically advanced, yet ruined world) and Final Fantasy VII ('protagonist awakens from a long slumber' could be loosely applied to FFVII's Cloud, and 'defeat an ancient evil' is a common trope. 'Princess' could also apply to FFVII's Aerith or other characters). They have no direct connection to Breath of the Wild.",,3,"The informed clues provide strong hints that, when combined, make the correct answer discoverable. The misinformed and fake clues are good at pulling attention away, but not so much that they make the game impossible. It requires careful consideration of all clues.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to Breath of the Wild without being too obvious.

They cover various aspects like social enjoyment, nutritional value, preparation, sensory experience, cultural significance, and emotional connection. There is no direct use of the answer word or obvious synonyms. The clues are distinct and explore different facets of the concept.",3,"The misinformed clues are somewhat ambiguous. 'Recreational purposes' and 'entertainment' could apply to 'book' or 'painting' as well as 'food' (e.g., enjoying a meal). The 'engaging multiple senses' part is a good hint towards food but could also apply to painting or books through imagination. The ambiguity is productive enough to cause some confusion.",5,"These clues effectively and strongly point to 'book' and 'painting' respectively, with no overlap to 'food'. 'Written account' and 'bound in a book format' directly describe a book. 'Visual artistry' and 'colors and shapes' clearly describe a painting. They are excellent at misdirecting the player away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to lead to the correct answer without being too obvious. The misinformed clues create enough ambiguity to make players pause and consider other options, while the fake clues strongly pull players towards incorrect answers.

They cover various aspects of the 'animal' classification without being too obvious. The variety of phrasing offers distinct angles.",4,These clues create productive ambiguity. The library clue has a tangential connection (classification/study) but misdirects to 'mineral' or a general concept of information. The garden clue strongly misdirects to 'plant' while having a weak thematic link to living organisms.,5,"These clues effectively misdirect. The gallery clue strongly points to 'mineral' (sculptures, gems) or even 'plant' (floral arrangements).

The clue about 'icy landscapes' is completely off for both the Tiger and African Elephant, making it less effective as a misdirection within the context of the actual answer.",4,"The clues for 'Tiger' and 'Giant Panda' are plausible descriptions for those animals and effectively misdirect away from the African Elephant, as they describe different characteristics and habitats. The 'icy landscapes' clue for the Tiger is a weak misdirection for the African Elephant but could be intended to mislead towards a polar bear if that were a choice. The 'lives in trees' and 'near water' clues for the Panda are good misdirections.",,3,"The informed clues are quite direct and specific, making the correct answer discoverable. The misinformed and fake clues offer enough plausible alternatives to prevent it from being too easy, striking a good balance.","The informed clues are excellent and meet all criteria.

The 'Mountaineering' clue also shares 'endurance, strength, mental fortitude' but misdirects with 'against the environment'. The ambiguity is productive.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first points strongly to 'Dancing' ('synchronized actions', 'artistic performance'). The second points strongly to 'Mountaineering' ('endurance, strength, mental fortitude against the environment').

The diversity of angles is good.",3,"The clue 'The game involves rapid movement across a rectangular field, with players attempting to score through goals' has a partial truth (rapid movement, rectangular field) but misdirects strongly towards American Football. The clue 'Participants race against each other on a track, trying to cross the finish line first, testing endurance' is less connected, but 'race' and 'endurance' could weakly link to the physical demands of tennis. The ambiguity is moderate.",5,"The fake clues are excellent.

The ambiguity is somewhat productive but could be sharper.",5,"These clues are excellent. The 'collection of stars and planets' clearly points to 'continent' (vast expanse) or even a broader celestial concept. The 'type of food item' points towards a regional aspect that might be associated with a continent or a very large geographical area, but not specifically a 'country'. They have no connection to the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are precise enough to guide players, while the misinformed and fake clues offer plausible distractions, creating a balanced challenge.
