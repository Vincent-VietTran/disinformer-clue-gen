They provide specific and distinct details related to 'movie' (darkened room, screen, visual narrative, visual storytelling medium, performance, design, audiences, viewers) without using any variations of the answer itself. They are challenging but clearly point to the correct answer.",1,"The misinformed clues are largely ineffective. The first clue, 'A collection of writings, bound together, telling a story or conveying information to the reader,' is a direct definition of 'book' and does not create productive ambiguity for 'movie' or suggest alternative interpretations in a subtle way.

The second clue is better, being vague enough to apply to multiple choices, but the first clue's directness undermines the set's purpose.",1,"The fake clues fail to meet the criteria. They are supposed to strongly point to one of the *incorrect answer choices* ('book' or 'play'). Instead, the first clue points to 'newspaper/magazine' and the second to 'music/song,' neither of which are available choices. This means they do not effectively misdirect players toward wrong options within the game's context.",,2,"The informed clues are strong and effective. However, the misinformed and fake clues are poorly designed according to the game's rules. The misinformed clue directly points to 'book,' and the fake clues point outside the given choices.

However, the misinformed and fake clue sets significantly deviate from the provided criteria. The misinformed clues do not effectively create productive ambiguity for the correct answer while subtly leading to others; one clue is too direct for an incorrect choice. The fake clues fail to misdirect to any of the *provided* incorrect choices, instead pointing to external, unlisted concepts.

However, the fake clues' failure to point to any of the *incorrect Star Wars options* makes the game harder than intended. Players would struggle to identify these as 'fake' in the context of misdirecting to a wrong choice, as they don't fit any of the Star Wars films at all.","The informed and misinformed clues are well-crafted and meet their respective criteria effectively. However, the fake clues are a significant failure, as they do not misdirect to any of the given incorrect answer choices, instead pointing completely outside the Star Wars universe.

However, the 'viewers' part is a slight inconsistency for podcasts. The second fake clue is weak, as 'mainly centers on promoting products and services' doesn't strongly or convincingly point to 'Video game' or 'Podcast' as their primary function, making it less effective at misdirection to the given wrong choices. It points more to advertising in general, not the choices provided.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively straightforward to deduce the correct answer if a player focuses solely on them. The misinformed clues are effective at creating plausible alternative interpretations. However, the weakness of the second fake clue reduces the overall difficulty, as it doesn't provide a strong misdirection towards one of the incorrect choices, potentially making the correct answer stand out more easily. It's not too hard, not too easy, leaning slightly easier due to strong informed and weak fake.","The informed and misinformed clues are well-crafted and meet their respective criteria effectively.

An informed player might deduce the correct answer by observing the disinformer's strong bias towards 'Novel', despite the flaws in their own clues.",14,14,100%,16.1
10,Historical Event,Moon Landing 1969,2,Moon Landing 1969,"Apollo 13, Moon Landing 1969, The Wright Brothers' First Flight",5,"The informed clues are excellent. They are highly specific to 'Moon Landing 1969' without using any forbidden words or their variations. They offer distinct angles: one focusing on the physical achievement ('spacecraft,' 'humans,' 'extraterrestrial celestial body's surface') and the other on its global impact and reception ('broadcast globally,' 'images,' 'historic exploration'). This provides clear, precise hints.",1,"The misinformed clues fail to meet the criteria. The first clue ('daring rescue mission...') strongly points to 'Apollo 13,' making it more of a 'fake' clue for the correct answer rather than a 'misinformed' one that subtly relates to the correct answer while creating ambiguity. The second clue ('fictional realm...') is completely irrelevant to any of the choices provided, offering no productive ambiguity or connection to the correct answer or any other choice.",1,"The fake clues are ineffective. Neither clue points convincingly to any of the *incorrect* answer choices ('Apollo 13', 'The Wright Brothers' First Flight'). The first clue ('historical battle...') suggests a military conflict, and the second ('individual's journey...') suggests a spiritual quest, neither of which aligns with the given options. They do not misdirect players toward plausible wrong options from the list.",,3,"The informed clues are well-crafted and provide enough specific detail to make the correct answer discoverable without being too obvious, placing the core puzzle difficulty at a 'just right' level. However, the misinformed and fake clues are largely ineffective, meaning they wouldn't contribute to the intended difficulty of the game's misinformation aspects. If the informed clues are the primary drivers, the difficulty is moderate.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-done, perfectly adhering to the criteria for specificity and avoidance of forbidden words. However, the misinformed and fake clues completely miss their mark. The misinformed clues act more like fake clues for a specific wrong answer, and the fake clues are entirely irrelevant to the given choices. This would make the 'disinformer' roles very challenging to play as intended, as their clues do not fulfill their purpose of creating productive ambiguity or misdirection among the provided options.",14,14,100%,15.9
