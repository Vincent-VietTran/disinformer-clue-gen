They cover various aspects like instrumentation, spirit, performance, themes, cultural impact, influences, and subgenres, all accurately describing 'Rock'.",2,"These clues are too vague. While factually true for 'Rock', they are also so general that they could apply to almost any music genre, including 'Pop' and 'Classic'. They don't create productive ambiguity because they don't offer any specific shared traits that would make a player guess between the options. They are almost universally true for any music.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Pop' by mentioning synthesizers, drum machines, and auto-tuned vocals. The second clue also points to 'Pop' with catchy melodies, upbeat rhythms, and a focus on romantic relationships. They successfully avoid any association with 'Rock'.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The 'Informed' clues are strong enough to guide someone towards 'Rock' if they are familiar with the genre, but the 'Fake' clues provide significant misdirection towards 'Pop', requiring careful consideration of the 'Informed' clues to confirm the correct answer.","The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are very well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively.

They are not productively ambiguous and offer no shared truth across all options.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. 'This song tells a story of overcoming challenges through courage, perseverance, and the power of unity with others' strongly suggests 'Stairway to Heaven' or 'Hotel California'. 'This soulful ballad explores the complexities of love and loss, tugging at the heartstrings of listeners worldwide' also points towards 'Hotel California' or potentially 'Stairway to Heaven'. They completely avoid any connection to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and are plausible for the incorrect choices.",,4,"The 'informed' clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer for someone familiar with the songs.

For example, 'designed to make people feel happy and energized' could be true for some Rock or Dance music, but not universally across those genres in the same way it applies to Pop. The primary failure is that they are not equally true for 'Rock' and 'Dance'.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Rock' with 'heavy guitar riffs' and 'powerful drumming'. The second clue clearly describes 'Rock' (or potentially other genres not listed, but definitely not 'Pop') with 'complex instrumental pieces' and 'long song durations'. They effectively pull attention away from 'Pop'.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong, and the fake clues provide excellent misdirection.

The second fake clue ('This song has a driving beat and rap verses...') also plausibly points towards 'Bad Guy' (though 'Shape of You' also has a distinct beat and can be interpreted as having rhythmic vocal delivery). These clues effectively misdirect from 'Blinding Lights' and target incorrect options.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable if the player focuses on them. However, the fake clues are quite effective at misdirection, requiring careful consideration of all clues to avoid being led astray.

They fail to create productive ambiguity as they offer no real distinguishing information that could be applied to the specific song or its incorrect choices. They are essentially tautological.",4,"These clues are well-crafted to misdirect. The first clue, 'A song with a catchy melody, smooth vocals, and a danceable rhythm that make it an instant hit,' strongly suggests 'In Da Club' or potentially 'Jumpman' due to their popular, upbeat nature, while steering clear of the more intense, narrative-driven 'Lose Yourself.' The second clue, 'It is a song that tells a story of love and loss, with heartfelt lyrics and a memorable chorus,' could plausibly apply to 'In Da Club' or even 'Jumpman' depending on interpretation, but is a poor fit for 'Lose Yourself,' effectively diverting attention.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify if one is familiar with the song or its context.

For example, 'The compositions often involve multiple instruments, creating a rich tapestry of sound for the audience to enjoy' is true for Classical, but also true for Opera and Instrumental music. However, the other clue, 'This style of music has been used in many different types of performances across multiple venues and settings,' is also too broad and doesn't effectively create ambiguity between the choices. The goal of misinformed clues is to be true for ALL options, which is not met here. They are too vague and don't create productive ambiguity.",5,"The 'Fake' clues are excellent at misdirection.
