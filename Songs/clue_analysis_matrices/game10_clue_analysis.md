| Status | Criteria |

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Folk' music without using any of the forbidden words. They highlight acoustic instrumentation, storytelling, oral tradition, simple melodies, social commentary, specific instruments (guitar, banjo, harmonica), lyrical themes, call-and-response, rural origins, and authenticity. Each clue points directly and uniquely to 'Folk' music.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The misinformed clues are too vague and essentially describe all music ('This genre often involves the use of vocals and instruments to create sounds that people can listen to.' and 'It is a form of musical expression that involves creating melodies and rhythms for people to enjoy.'). While factually true for Folk, Jazz, and Blues, they offer no productive ambiguity because they are so universally applicable to any music genre. They don't create confusion between the choices, but rather fail to distinguish any of them.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent misdirections. The first clue ('This genre often uses complex harmonies and improvisational solos to create a unique and complex soundscape.') strongly points to 'Jazz'. The second clue ('This genre's music is known for its syncopated rhythms and the use of brass instruments in its music.') also strongly points to 'Jazz' and could also potentially apply to certain aspects of 'Blues' but not as directly as 'Jazz'. Neither clue has any relevance to 'Folk'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Generic/vague clues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues
- Missing specificity in clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted for specificity without contamination. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards Jazz. The misinformed clues are too generic and fail to create productive ambiguity, which is the main area for improvement. The difficulty is appropriate for a game scenario where informed clues should be strong and fake clues should be plausible distractions.
