## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, avoiding any answer contamination or synonyms. They cover various aspects of the genre's origins, techniques, lyrical content, and cultural impact.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague and could apply to almost any music genre. They don't offer enough shared truth to create productive ambiguity and feel more like generic music descriptions rather than clues designed to mislead specifically between the choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirections. They perfectly describe R&B, a strong incorrect choice, and are completely unrelated to Hip-Hop, effectively steering players away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and accurately describe the chosen answer without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects of the song's narrative, context (film), and lyrical themes, providing strong pointers to 'Lose Yourself'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are far too vague. While factually true, they could apply to almost any popular song by a male artist. They fail to create productive ambiguity as they offer no real distinguishing information that could be applied to the specific song or its incorrect choices. They are essentially tautological.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues are well-crafted to misdirect. The first clue, 'A song with a catchy melody, smooth vocals, and a danceable rhythm that make it an instant hit,' strongly suggests 'In Da Club' or potentially 'Jumpman' due to their popular, upbeat nature, while steering clear of the more intense, narrative-driven 'Lose Yourself.' The second clue, 'It is a song that tells a story of love and loss, with heartfelt lyrics and a memorable chorus,' could plausibly apply to 'In Da Club' or even 'Jumpman' depending on interpretation, but is a poor fit for 'Lose Yourself,' effectively diverting attention.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

The fake clues are good at misdirection, but the strength of the informed clues balances this out, resulting in a moderate difficulty.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**

The informed clues are excellent, providing a clear path to the correct answer. The fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards incorrect options. The misinformed clues are too vague to be useful and need to be more creative in their shared ambiguity.
