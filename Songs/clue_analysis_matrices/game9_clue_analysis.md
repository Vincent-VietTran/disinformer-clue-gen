## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.9 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Reggae, using descriptive language that accurately captures its key characteristics without using the answer word or direct synonyms. They cover rhythm, origin, lyrical themes, tempo, instrumentation, cultural associations, performance style, and global impact.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers. For instance, 'relaxing and catchy rhythms' is not a primary defining characteristic of Heavy Metal, and 'vibrant and energetic culture' is debatable for Ska compared to Reggae.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are very effective at misdirecting players towards 'Heavy Metal'. The first clue perfectly describes Heavy Metal's common characteristics, and the second clue also points strongly towards it, while being completely unrelated to Reggae.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The 'informed' clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify if a player knows about music genres. However, the 'fake' clues are highly misleading and well-crafted, creating significant confusion for those who are less familiar with the nuances of these genres. This balance between precise correct clues and deceptive incorrect clues makes it a challenging game.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'informed' clues are excellent, providing detailed and accurate descriptions of Reggae. The 'fake' clues are highly effective misdirection for Heavy Metal. The 'misinformed' clues fail to meet the criteria of being true for all incorrect answers and are too vague, thus not contributing to productive ambiguity. The difficulty is appropriately high due to the strong fake clues.

### Informed Clues: 5/5

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
