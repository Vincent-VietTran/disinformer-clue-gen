---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of 'Team Sport' without using any forbidden words. They effectively highlight collaboration, shared objectives, roles, and strategic planning. The variety of angles (roles, strategy, camaraderie, coaching) is excellent.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are far too general and do not create productive ambiguity. They are true for almost any competitive activity and do not plausibly describe any of the incorrect choices (Individual Sport, Dual Sport) while also being true for Team Sport. They are essentially tautological statements about competition.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Individual Sport' and 'Dual Sport'. They focus on individual talent, one-on-one competition, and personal physical boundaries, which are the antithesis of the provided 'Informed' clues for 'Team Sport'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer. The 'Fake' clues are also quite strong in their misdirection. The 'Misinformed' clues are the weakest link, being too general to be useful. This balance leans towards a moderate difficulty.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct reasons for the answer. The 'Fake' clues are also very good at misdirection. The 'Misinformed' clues are the primary area for improvement as they lack the required ambiguity and shared truth across all options.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are very specific to soccer, using descriptive language that avoids direct terminology. They cover various aspects like player actions, global reach, physical demands, strategy, skills, rules, game structure, and attire without using the word 'soccer' or its direct synonyms. The clues are distinct and offer different angles on the sport.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are far too general. While factually true for soccer, they are also true for basketball and football to a significant degree. They do not create productive ambiguity because they are almost entirely devoid of specific detail that could differentiate between the choices. They are too vague to be useful for misdirection or creating confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Basketball'. They specifically mention shooting a ball through a hoop and playing on a court, which are defining characteristics of basketball and completely irrelevant to soccer or football.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are excellent and specific, making the correct answer identifiable for someone familiar with the sport. However, the misinformed clues are so vague and the fake clues so strongly point to basketball that the overall puzzle might lean towards being too easy if the player focuses on eliminating the fake clues first. A player might struggle to connect the general misinformed clues to soccer if they can't discard them easily, but the strong fake clues make it solvable. The difficulty is moderate.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are of excellent quality and highly specific to the answer. The fake clues are also excellent, providing strong misdirection towards basketball. The misinformed clues are the weakest link, being too vague to be effectively ambiguous. The game is well-structured with strong correct and fake clues.
