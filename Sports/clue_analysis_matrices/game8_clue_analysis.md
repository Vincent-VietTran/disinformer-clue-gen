## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues effectively describe the core aspects of esports, focusing on virtual arenas, skill, strategy, digital interfaces, broadcasts, and professional aspects. They are specific enough to point directly to esports without being overly broad.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too general and could apply to almost any competitive activity. They do not create productive ambiguity for the given choices because they are so broad. For example, 'This activity involves competition and skill, often with defined rules and objectives for participants to follow' is true for combat sports, ball games, and esports.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Combat Sports'. They focus on 'physical strength', 'endurance', 'intense training', and 'physical arena', which are all key characteristics of combat sports and completely absent in esports.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

1. Minor length adjustments

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to League of Legends, using terms like 'nexus' and highlighting the core gameplay loop of destroying the enemy base while defending structures. They avoid generic descriptions and focus on unique aspects of the game. No answer contamination or synonyms were used.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague. While factually true for League of Legends, they are also completely true for Dota 2 and Valorant. They offer no productive ambiguity and are essentially generic descriptions of competitive team-based games. They fail the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers without providing any distinguishing information.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points towards Valorant with its emphasis on 'fast-paced, close-quarters combat, utilizing various weapons'. The second clue also strongly suggests Valorant with 'precision aiming in a team-based scenario'. They completely avoid any connection to League of Legends.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are extremely strong, making the correct answer obvious if one is familiar with the genre. However, the 'Fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards Valorant, increasing the challenge of distinguishing between the correct answer and a plausible incorrect one, especially if the player has only a superficial understanding of the games. The 'Misinformed' clues are so weak they don't contribute to the difficulty in a positive way.

3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific to League of Legends. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards Valorant. The 'Misinformed' clues are too generic and do not contribute to productive ambiguity, failing to be true for all incorrect answers without providing any distinguishing information.
