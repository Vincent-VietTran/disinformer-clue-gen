They are true for almost any competitive activity and do not plausibly describe any of the incorrect choices (Individual Sport, Dual Sport) while also being true for Team Sport. They are essentially tautological statements about competition.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Individual Sport' and 'Dual Sport'. They focus on individual talent, one-on-one competition, and personal physical boundaries, which are the antithesis of the provided 'Informed' clues for 'Team Sport'.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer. The 'Fake' clues are also quite strong in their misdirection. The 'Misinformed' clues are the weakest link, being too general to be useful. This balance leans towards a moderate difficulty.","The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct reasons for the answer. The 'Fake' clues are also very good at misdirection.

The clues are distinct and offer different angles on the sport.",1,"These clues are far too general. While factually true for soccer, they are also true for basketball and football to a significant degree. They do not create productive ambiguity because they are almost entirely devoid of specific detail that could differentiate between the choices. They are too vague to be useful for misdirection or creating confusion.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Basketball'. They specifically mention shooting a ball through a hoop and playing on a court, which are defining characteristics of basketball and completely irrelevant to soccer or football.",,4,"The informed clues are excellent and specific, making the correct answer identifiable for someone familiar with the sport. However, the misinformed clues are so vague and the fake clues so strongly point to basketball that the overall puzzle might lean towards being too easy if the player focuses on eliminating the fake clues first. A player might struggle to connect the general misinformed clues to soccer if they can't discard them easily, but the strong fake clues make it solvable. The difficulty is moderate.","The informed clues are of excellent quality and highly specific to the answer. The fake clues are also excellent, providing strong misdirection towards basketball. The misinformed clues are the weakest link, being too vague to be effectively ambiguous. The game is well-structured with strong correct and fake clues.",15,15,100%,17.0

They fail the crucial requirement of being true for all incorrect answers while being ambiguous.,5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They perfectly describe 'Team Sport' by emphasizing 'players working together', 'coordinating actions', 'collective effort', and 'team's overall strategy and success', making them highly plausible for an incorrect choice.",,2,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. The 'Fake' clues effectively point away from the correct answer. The 'Misinformed' clues are too weak and general to add any meaningful difficulty or ambiguity.",The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively.

They clearly differentiate boxing from the other choices.",2,"The provided 'misinformed' clues are too general and do not effectively create ambiguity.

They directly describe elements common in MMA and wrestling (grappling, submissions, striking and grappling combinations) and are completely unrelated to boxing, strongly steering players towards the incorrect answers.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively clear to someone familiar with combat sports. The 'fake' clues are very effective at misdirecting, but the overall balance leans towards a moderate difficulty, especially if the player can identify the specific nuances of the informed clues.","The 'informed' and 'fake' clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively.

3,Sports,1,Dual Sport,"Team Sport, Individual Sport, Dual Sport",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using phrases like 'two competitors or sides', 'direct opposition', 'head-to-head format', and 'two parties to engage in a physical competition'. These directly point to the nature of a dual sport without using the answer words or obvious synonyms. They avoid being overly general.",2,"The misinformed clues are too generic and could apply to almost any competitive activity, not just sports. 'Physical exertion, strategic thinking, and mental toughness' and 'human individuals engage in activities, requiring physical effort, developing skills, and strategic thinking' are true for team, individual, and dual sports. They don't create productive ambiguity because they offer no real distinguishing features. They are factually true for all options but lack the nuance needed for effective ambiguity.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of fake clues. The first clue ('group of people working together to achieve a shared goal') strongly points to 'Team Sport' without mentioning it.

The variety of phrasing is good.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three sports (tennis, badminton, pickleball) as they all involve a court, a net, a ball/shuttlecock, skill, strategy, and physical competition. However, they are quite general and might not create 'productive ambiguity' as much as a slightly more specific but still shared clue could. They don't actively mislead but don't strongly point away from tennis either.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirections. The first clue directly targets badminton ('shuttlecock') and the second targets pickleball ('paddles'). Neither clue is true for tennis, effectively steering the player away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards tennis, but the misinformed clues are general enough that a player might hesitate. The fake clues are very effective at misdirection, balancing the difficulty.",The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to tennis.

4,Sports,1,Physical sports,"Physical sports, Mind sports, Motor sports",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using excellent paraphrasing. They clearly point to 'Physical sports' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. The variety of angles covered (exertion, strength, rules, judgment, strategy, entertainment, training, physical limits) is excellent.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirements. They are true for 'Physical sports' but are also likely true for 'Mind sports' (strategic planning, competition, rules, scoring) and 'Motor sports' (competition, rules, scoring, human participants).

The 'Fake' clues are also very effective, providing strong misdirection towards 'Mind sports' and 'Motor sports'. The major weakness lies in the 'Misinformed' clues, which are too general and fail to meet the requirement of being true for all incorrect options while remaining ambiguous.

4,Sports,2,Rugby,"Rugby, AFL, american football",4,"Most clues are descriptive and avoid answer words. Some could be slightly more varied in their focus (e.g., not all about physical action).
