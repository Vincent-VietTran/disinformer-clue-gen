based on this criteria: "misinformed": """Vague and ambiguous clues. True but overly general clues that are a mutual, shared truth among all options.
    - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY FOR EACH CLUE):
        - Be 100% factually true for the correct answer.
        - Also be 100% factually true for ALL of the incorrect answers. This is a non-negotiable rule to ensure the clue is maximally ambiguous and offers no information to eliminate any option.
        - Avoid clues that are only true for an incorrect answer (a "Fake" clue) or only true for the correct answer (an "Informed" clue). The goal is a total shared intersection of truth.
        - AVOID SPECIFICITY: Do not use defining keywords or tropes. Focus only on the most general, shared truths (e.g., "involves suspense" or "features characters").

    - Examples:
        - Correct misinformed clue (Movie category, answer: "Sci-Fi", choices: "Sci-Fi, Horror, Fantasy"): "This genre often features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats." (True for Sci-Fi AND Horror/Fantasy.)
        - Incorrect misinformed clue (would be "Informed") (Historical Event category, answer: "Moon Landing", choices: "Moon Landing, Apollo 13, First Flight"): "This historic event was famously broadcast on live television, with one man taking a 'giant leap'." (Only true for Moon Landing, not for Apollo 13 or First Flight.)
        - Incorrect misinformed clue (would be "Fake") (Historical Event category, answer: "Moon Landing", choices: "Moon Landing, Apollo 13, First Flight"): "The story centers on a daring rescue mission with a team facing perilous conditions and impossible odds." (Only true for Apollo 13, not for Moon Landing or First Flight.)
