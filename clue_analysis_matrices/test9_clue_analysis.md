---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally specific to the answer 'country'. Clue 1 is a good example, as it mentions 'geographic areas separated by physical barriers', which is a key characteristic of countries. However, Clue 5 could be more specific, as it mentions 'governance models vary from authoritarian to democratic systems', which could apply to other topics as well. Clue 8 mentions 'environmental factors such as climate geography and natural resources impact country development significantly', which is a good example of a specific and relevant clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Clue 1 in the misinformed section could apply to other topics such as family history or nationality

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are generally related to the answer 'country', but they could be more ambiguous. Clue 1 in the misinformed section mentions 'a person's place of origin and upbringing in their family lineage', which is a vague description that could apply to other topics. Clue 2 mentions 'a country is formed when two or more nations unify under one government peacefully', which is a specific event that could be related to countries, but it's not vague enough to create productive doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The fake clues are generally clear in their misdirection, but they could be more effective. Clue 1 mentions 'the country's borders are determined by the number of people living within its territory', which is a plausible description of how borders could be determined, but it doesn't clearly point to the other answer choices. Clue 2 mentions 'a country's name often reflects the dominant language spoken by its inhabitants directly', which is a true statement, but it doesn't clearly misdirect to the other answer choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues are highly specific and relate directly to the correct answer.
