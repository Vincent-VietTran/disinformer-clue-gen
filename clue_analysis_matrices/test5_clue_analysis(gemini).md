## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.0 words

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Good specificity in mentioning controllers, simulated worlds, interactive stories, strategic choices, resource management, and problem-solving. No answer contamination. Distinct angle focusing on interactivity and player agency.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The ambiguity is decent. 'Linear narratives' and 'passive viewing experience' could apply to poorly designed games, creating some confusion without directly pointing away from the correct answer. Could be stronger if it focused on aspects games *can* share with books or songs.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues strongly point to books (turning pages, written storytelling) and songs (musical composition, melody, rhythm, harmony) respectively. They effectively avoid any association with video games.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
Overall, a well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are strong, the misinformed clues provide reasonable ambiguity, and the fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards the wrong answers. Minor improvement could be made to the misinformed clues to better highlight aspects games *can* share with the incorrect answers, thus increasing the productive confusion.
