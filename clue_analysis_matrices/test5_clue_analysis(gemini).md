---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.7 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific and avoid the answer word. They focus on digital entertainment and virtual world experiences, effectively pointing to video games. Could be slightly more distinct.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The samples are related to the answer (entertainment) but are broad enough to apply to multiple choices. 'Something you can read...' could be a book, and the art example doesn't strongly suggest any choice. The ambiguity is decent.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples clearly point to the wrong answer choices. One references literature (book) and the other describes a movie. They effectively misdirect away from video games and are believable.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are highly specific to Breath of the Wild. The amnesia and open-world exploration are key elements. No answer contamination.

✅ Strengths:

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5
