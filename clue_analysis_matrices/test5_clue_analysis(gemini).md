---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific and distinct, directly relating to the gameplay elements of a video game without explicitly mentioning the term. Score slightly lowered because 'players' can be used in other contexts.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The samples are ambiguous enough to apply to both 'video game' and potentially 'novel' (if the novel has multimedia components) and 'movie' (easily). They relate to information delivery which is a broader concept.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first sample could apply to a 'novel' or a 'video game' (digital assets). The second sample clearly points towards 'movie.' Both effectively misdirect away from the core gameplay aspect of a video game.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
