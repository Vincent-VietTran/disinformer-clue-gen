**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1 is excellent, describing the open world and physics. Clue 2 is also strong, referencing the core plot. Clue 3 is good, mentioning the stamina system. Clues 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are also specific and well-written, focusing on non-linearity, crafting, combat, exploration, and combat strategies. Clue 7 is a little weaker; many games have NPCs, but it is still relevant. All clues avoid answer contamination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the genre but are not specific to the correct answer. Clue 1, while hinting at conflict, could apply to many games. Clue 2 is very generic and could fit a multitude of games. They are vague enough to create doubt but could be more subtly linked to the correct answer's themes or mechanics.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are perfect for misdirection. Clue 1 points towards a fantasy game, possibly Elden Ring. Clue 2 points to a space exploration game, which fits the general theme of Red Dead Redemption 2. These clues are very effective in diverting attention away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
