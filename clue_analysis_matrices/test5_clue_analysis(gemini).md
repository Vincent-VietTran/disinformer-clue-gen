## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both clues are specific and distinct, avoiding the term 'video game'. They focus on digital entertainment, user interaction, virtual environments and player actions which are all key characteristics.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues are related to the answer (entertainment) but are broad enough to apply to multiple choices. The first clue is a general description of books, and the second is about painting, creating productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both clues strongly point to the WRONG choices. The first clue refers to musical instruments, and the second to cinema, effectively misdirecting the player away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**
