## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally good, providing specific details about the game. Clue 1 highlights exploration, a key aspect. Clue 2 alludes to the plot. Clue 3 mentions gameplay mechanics. Clue 4 focuses on resource management and combat. Clue 5 discusses narrative. Clue 6 focuses on cooking. Clue 7 highlights climbing. Clue 8 talks about the main character's journey. Clue 9 mentions physics-based gameplay. Some clues could be slightly more specific (e.g., specifying 'shrines' in Clue 3 or 'Koroks' in Clue 1), but overall, they are effective. No clues contain the answer directly.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the genre but less specific. Clue 1, 'It centers around a character seeking to become a leader amidst political intrigue within a city,' is too general and could apply to many games. Clue 2, 'The storyline focuses on a group of friends working to solve mysteries in a small, suburban town,' is also vague and does not strongly relate to the answer, but it creates productive doubt by hinting at a different type of game. The clues are not bad, but they are not very effective in creating doubt about the answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues effectively misdirect. Clue 1, 'A tale of knights and dragons, where a young hero must retrieve a magical artifact to save the kingdom,' clearly points toward a fantasy game such as the Red Dead Redemption 2. Clue 2, 'Follows a detective solving crimes using intelligence and deduction to unveil the truth behind events,' could be a detective-style game, which could apply to Horizon Zero Dawn, though less directly. The clues are distinct and clearly suggest other game possibilities.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
