**Test Run 10 | Round 1: Historical Event → Moon Landing 1969**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.3 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are good, highlighting the documentation, societal impact, memory, and turning point aspects of historical events. They avoid direct synonyms and are specific enough. A slightly more varied angle could improve it.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The first misinformed clue ('celebrated with parades') has a weak connection to historical events as many things are celebrated, and it could easily point to a 'Space Mission' (e.g., a successful launch celebration) or even an 'Invention' (e.g., a public unveiling). The second clue ('team working together') is also quite general and could apply to all choices. The ambiguity is present but could be more potent.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues are effective. 'High seas, pirates, treasure' strongly points to a narrative that is not a Historical Event, Space Mission, or Invention. 'Mystical realm, magic, mythical creatures' is clearly fantasy and points away from all factual choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are specific and avoid direct keywords or synonyms. They offer distinct angles on the event, covering the journey, broadcast, achievement, context, and technological aspects without being overly obvious. The clues directly relate to the 'Moon Landing 1969' while carefully avoiding 'Apollo 13' and 'The Wright Brothers'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by referencing space travel and critical situations, which are themes present in 'Moon Landing 1969' but more strongly associated with 'Apollo 13'. They maintain a conceptual connection to the correct answer while subtly misdirecting towards an incorrect one, leading to productive confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. One clue strongly points to 'Apollo 13' with themes of rescue and critical malfunctions, while the other points to 'The Wright Brothers' with its focus on aviation and early flight. Neither has any genuine connection to 'Moon Landing 1969', ensuring they misdirect players to incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
