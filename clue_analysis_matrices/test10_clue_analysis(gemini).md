| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are fairly specific to historical events, mentioning collective memory, shaping future generations, and scholarly analysis. They avoid using the term 'historical event' directly. A slightly more distinct angle could be explored.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat related to the idea of a historical event in that personal journeys and artistic expression *can* be influenced by them. However, they are a bit too vague and don't create a strong sense of productive confusion with the concept of a historical event. They lean more towards general human experiences.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues do a good job of pointing away from 'Historical Event'. The 'imaginary tale' strongly suggests fiction, which contrasts with the factual nature of historical events. The 'routine occurrence' directly opposes the significance and impact associated with historical events. They are believable as descriptions of things that are *not* historical events.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

1. Minor length adjustments

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are reasonably specific without using the answer words. The mention of a 'national objective' and 'competition between superpowers' helps narrow it down, as does 'celestial body' and 'first steps'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The misinformed clues are not very effective. They are related to discovery and exploration, which has some connection to space exploration, but are quite generic and don't create much productive ambiguity. They are more distracting than confusing.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues effectively point away from the correct answer. The 'catastrophic natural event' and 'medical breakthrough' are clearly unrelated to the moon landing but could relate to the disasters.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
