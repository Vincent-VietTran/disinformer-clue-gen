## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are all quite specific to historical events, mentioning concepts like societal impact, transitions, influence, causes/effects, milestones, and transformation. Clue 5 is slightly less strong, as it mentions 'documented and remembered', which could apply to other choices. However, overall the clues are quite good at pointing towards the correct answer. No clues contain the answer word, which is good. The language used is sophisticated, which adds to the quality.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer (historical events), but they are vague enough to apply to multiple choices. Clue 1 mentions 'brief moments or extended periods of time' and a 'gathering of people', which could describe artistic movements or geographical features. Clue 2 is even more vague as it describes 'planned celebrations' which can be applied to all three choices. The clues are not bad, but they could be improved by being more closely linked to historical events, but still vague enough to cause doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 clearly refers to a 'complex and often unpredictable phenomenon, involving weather patterns' pointing to a geographical feature. Clue 2 discusses a 'creative endeavor, often confused with design, using diverse techniques' which points towards an artistic movement. These clues are very effective in misdirecting the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

The overall difficulty is moderate, as the player needs to carefully evaluate all clues to choose the correct answer. The use of sophisticated language adds to the difficulty.
