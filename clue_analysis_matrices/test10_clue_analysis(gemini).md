## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, avoiding any direct mention or synonyms of 'Documentary'. They focus on the core characteristics of factual presentation, real-world subjects, and educational intent. The clues offer diverse angles while consistently reinforcing the intended answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are good. The first clue, 'This form of media often showcases a person's life, chronicling their achievements and challenges over time,' plausibly describes a Biography while still having some overlap with a documentary about a person. The second clue, 'It frequently involves actors, set designs, and fictional stories to provide entertainment and dramatic experiences,' strongly points to a fictional narrative, which could be a distractor if the user incorrectly associates 'entertainment' with the other options.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They are completely unrelated to 'Documentary' and strongly and plausibly describe fictional narrative types, effectively misdirecting towards incorrect choices. 'This narrative genre typically involves fictional characters and settings, creating an entertaining experience for viewers' and 'Often written to explore characters' lives and the historical events that shaped their unique personalities and stories' are very strong indicators of fictional genres.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, focusing on the themes of kindness, community, and children's education associated with the correct answer without using any of the answer words or obvious synonyms. They effectively build a clear picture of the subject.

The misinformed clues are moderately effective. The first clue uses 'visionary' and 'technology industry' which strongly points to Steve Jobs, but could be interpreted broadly.

There's a slight overlap in 'exploring' and 'mysteries' which could be seen as very subtle misdirection, but they are generally well-separated.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. The first is a perfect description of Steve Jobs, and the second is a perfect description of Cosmos, with no overlap or relation to the correct answer. They are designed to strongly and plausibly describe the incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
