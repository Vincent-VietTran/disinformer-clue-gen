## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific to historical events (e.g., shaping civilizations, pivotal transitions) without directly mentioning the answer. They provide distinct angles by highlighting impact and change.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues (e.g., gatherings, planned celebrations) are vague enough to apply to both historical events and other choices like geographical features or artistic movements. They create productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues (e.g., weather patterns, creative endeavors) clearly point to the wrong answer choices (geographical features, artistic movements) and avoid any mention of historical events. They are believable and effective misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
