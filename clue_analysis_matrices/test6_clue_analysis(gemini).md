## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific to food, avoiding the word 'food'. One focuses on social aspects, the other on biological necessity. Distinct angles.

✅ Strengths:

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The 'movie' clues are related to the answer (movies involve food in many ways) but broad enough to apply to multiple choices. Creates some ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'novel' clues clearly point to the wrong answer choice, focusing on writing and stories, and the 'music' clue points to the wrong answer. No mention of food.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
