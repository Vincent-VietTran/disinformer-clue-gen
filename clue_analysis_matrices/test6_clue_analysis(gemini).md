## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong, providing specific details related to food. Clue 1 mentions taste and preparation, which is good. Clue 2 focuses on human need and pleasure. Clue 3 highlights cultural importance. Clue 5 discusses communal and personal experiences. Clue 7 mentions comfort and sensory experience. Clue 8 refers to nutrients. Clue 9 touches upon traditions and heritage. Some clues could be more specific; for example, 'preparation' is vague, but overall, they successfully point to the answer. Clue 4 is a bit redundant.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer (food) but are vague enough to apply to the other choices. Clue 1 could apply to furniture (decorating a room), and Clue 2 could apply to vehicle (art gallery is a stretch, but is a way to make the clue more vague). They do create some ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 is about communication, which is entirely unrelated to any of the answers. Clue 2 discusses travel and freedom, which is a good misdirection for 'vehicle'. This is very effective.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

All informed clues meet length requirements. Clues are generally good, but some could be slightly more specific. Clue 2 mentioning a flag is very strong and specific. Clue 6 mentioning a specific type of cheese is also excellent. Clue 1, while accurate, is a bit generic. Clue 3 and 8 are a little less specific, but still relevant. Clue 4 is good. Clue 5 and 7 are also good and sufficiently specific. Clue 9 is a little generic.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Both misinformed clues are related to the general topic of food/cooking, but they don't strongly suggest *Pizza Margherita*. They could apply to many dishes, but the connection is a bit tenuous (artwork/showroom). They achieve ambiguity, but the connection could be strengthened.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues are excellent at misdirection. They steer the player away from pizza and towards the other answers by suggesting artistic endeavors. The clues are well-crafted and effectively misleading.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
