## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. They all avoid the answer word. Clue 1 is good, describing the social aspect of food. Clue 2 highlights the preparation. Clue 3 mentions cultural heritage. Clue 4 focuses on nutrition. Clue 5 covers flavors and textures. Clue 6 touches on celebrations. Clue 7 discusses culinary design. Clue 8 talks about comfort and nostalgia. Clue 9 mentions economic activity. All clues are specific enough to relate to food, though some are more general than others. The variety of angles is good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are effective at creating ambiguity. Clue 1, while related to the concept of food as entertainment, is vague enough to apply to other choices (movies). Clue 2 is related to the idea of food as self-expression but could apply to books or movies as well.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 clearly points to 'book' (information). Clue 2 clearly points to 'movie' (transportation).

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues are excellent. They are all very specific to Pizza Margherita, mentioning ingredients, origins, and cultural significance. No clues contain the answer. Clues 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all provide strong and distinct descriptions.

✅ Strengths:

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to food and dining experiences, but vague enough to apply to multiple Italian dishes and not specific to Pizza Margherita. Clue 1 mentions 'complex special effects' which is unusual and could confuse, and clue 2 mentions a protagonist, which is a bit too abstract. They could be improved by being more generic while hinting at the food category. However, they do not directly contradict the prompt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues are excellent. They clearly point to other answer choices. Clue 1 alludes to complex relationships (Pasta Carbonara) and clue 2 to action and adventure (Chicken Parmesan). They are unrelated to Pizza Margherita.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
