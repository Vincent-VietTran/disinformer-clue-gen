## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are specific and point well to 'food'. They cover various aspects like social enjoyment, nutritional value, preparation, sensory experience, cultural significance, and emotional connection. There is no direct use of the answer word or obvious synonyms. The clues are distinct and explore different facets of the concept.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat ambiguous. 'Recreational purposes' and 'entertainment' could apply to 'book' or 'painting' as well as 'food' (e.g., enjoying a meal). The 'engaging multiple senses' part is a good hint towards food but could also apply to painting or books through imagination. The ambiguity is productive enough to cause some confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues effectively and strongly point to 'book' and 'painting' respectively, with no overlap to 'food'. 'Written account' and 'bound in a book format' directly describe a book. 'Visual artistry' and 'colors and shapes' clearly describe a painting. They are excellent at misdirecting the player away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
