## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of developing deep emotional bonds and relationships between individuals, using varied phrasing to describe courtship, affection, and connection without using the answer word or its direct synonyms. They effectively highlight the core elements of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The 'misinformed' clues provide a good level of ambiguity. The first clue about humorous situations and lighthearted storytelling could be interpreted as a component of some romantic narratives, while also pointing towards Comedy. The second clue about complex characters facing difficult situations and exploring themes of conflict and resolution could apply to Drama, and also to the challenges within romantic relationships, creating a productive confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue about witty remarks, wordplay, and provoking laughter strongly points to Comedy. The second clue about dramatic conflict, emotional depth, and character development strongly points to Drama. Both are plausible descriptions of the incorrect choices and completely avoid any connection to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear if one focuses on them. However, the misinformed clues offer enough overlap and potential confusion with the other genres to prevent it from being trivially easy. The fake clues are also well-crafted to pull players towards incorrect answers. This combination creates a balanced challenge.

**Main Issues:**

1. Minor length adjustments

3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
Excellent clue construction. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. The misinformed clues create effective ambiguity, and the fake clues strongly misdirect towards incorrect answers. The difficulty is well-balanced.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Pride and Prejudice' without using any forbidden words. They cover the core themes of social class, evolving relationships, societal expectations, personal growth, and misunderstandings, all accurately reflecting the source material.

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
