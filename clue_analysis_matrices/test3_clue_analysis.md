## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.7 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the 'Action' genre, using terms like 'explosions', 'fist fights', 'high-speed chases', 'stunts', 'physical conflict', 'physical challenges', 'practical effects', 'daring rescues', and 'intense confrontations'. These terms are directly associated with action and do not overlap significantly with 'Thriller' or 'Adventure' in a way that would cause confusion. The language is descriptive and avoids answer contamination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are somewhat ambiguous. 'High stakes and suspense' can apply to Action, Thriller, and even some Adventures. 'Hero or protagonist facing difficult challenges and circumstances that are threatening' is also very general and could apply to all three. The ambiguity is productive, as it could lead a player to consider 'Thriller' or 'Adventure' based on perceived overlap in 'suspense' or 'challenges'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. 'Mystery that needs to be solved with clues and suspenseful moments' strongly points towards 'Thriller'. 'Complex plot that explores characters' inner struggles and motivations' also leans heavily towards 'Thriller' or potentially a character-driven 'Adventure', effectively steering players away from 'Action'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are very strong, making 'Action' quite identifiable. However, the 'Misinformed' clues provide just enough overlap with 'Thriller' and 'Adventure' to prevent it from being a completely trivial identification. The 'Fake' clues are well-crafted to misdirect towards 'Thriller'. The balance between clear indicators and plausible misdirection places it in the middle range.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are exceptionally well-crafted and specific to the 'Action' genre. The 'Fake' clues effectively target 'Thriller' by focusing on mystery and character depth. The 'Misinformed' clues offer a moderate level of ambiguity, creating a plausible but not overwhelming overlap with 'Thriller' and 'Adventure'.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using any of its direct keywords. They accurately describe the visual style, narrative elements, character roles, and action sequences that are unique to the film. No answer contamination or overly broad descriptions.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for 'Mad Max: Fury Road' but are general enough to also apply to 'Indiana Jones' (adventure, obstacles, difficult circumstances) and potentially 'Psycho' (suspense, high stakes, thrilling story - though less so). They create a moderate level of ambiguity, as intended.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue strongly points to a detective/mystery film, which is not 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. The second clue is a perfect description of 'Indiana Jones', making it a very strong misdirection away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
