## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong, providing specific details about sport. Clue 1, 'This competitive activity demands physical prowess and strategic planning, with participants striving to achieve victory and overcome opponents.' is a good starting point. Clue 3, 'Spectators often watch these events, creating a culture of fandom and providing financial support through various means.' is also effective. Clue 5, 'It is a popular pastime enjoyed recreationally by people of all ages and skill levels across the globe.' is a bit generic. Clue 6, 'Broadcast on television to global audiences, this sport generates significant income through its valuable broadcasting rights and sponsorships.' is very strong. Clue 8, 'Physical abilities are tested in this activity; strategic thinking and mental fortitude are also crucial elements.' is a good description. No clues contain the word 'sport'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer but are vague enough to apply to multiple choices. Clue 1, 'This often involves creative expression, allowing individuals to communicate ideas and emotions through various mediums.' could apply to art and music. Clue 2, 'It provides opportunities for collaborative efforts, where individuals combine their skills to achieve a shared objective.' could apply to art, music, or sport. They could be improved by being more strongly associated with the incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues effectively misdirect toward the incorrect answer choices. Clue 1, 'This is a form of artistic expression, using tools and materials to create visual representations for enjoyment.' clearly points to art. Clue 2, 'Practitioners often engage in techniques to manage stress and improve mental clarity, which is very helpful.' could be related to music or art, but doesn't strongly suggest either. The clues are effective.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
