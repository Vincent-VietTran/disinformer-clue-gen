## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are highly specific to sport, mentioning competition, physical prowess, strategic planning, rules, and victory. They avoid the word 'sport' effectively.

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5

The samples are related to sport in the sense that teamwork and creative expression can be involved in sports, but they are vague enough to apply to art and music. They create productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The samples strongly point to the wrong answer (art). They mention artistic expression, visual representations, tools, and stress management, all relevant to art and completely unrelated to the correct answer (sport).
