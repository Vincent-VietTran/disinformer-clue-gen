## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1, 'This engaging activity commonly features competitive elements, demanding physical prowess, strategic planning, and the pursuit of triumph over rivals,' is a good starting point. Clue 2, 'Regulations, specialized gear, and designated areas are frequently found within this structured form of recreational involvement for participants,' is also strong. Clue 3, 'Dedicated competitors consistently undergo rigorous training regimens to refine their abilities, endurance, and overall field performance successfully,' continues the theme. Clue 5, 'The outcome of this activity is typically determined by objective measures such as time or score,' is a good specific detail. Clue 6, 'Depending upon the competition's style, this promotes personal accomplishments and collaborative efforts, fostering unity and shared objectives,' works well. Clue 8, 'This provides a stage for skilled individuals to exhibit their capabilities and actively pursue superior standards of performance and execution,' is a little more generic but still acceptable. Clue 9, 'It often features global competitions, uniting various cultures and backgrounds through respectful and spirited athletic engagements worldwide,' is another good, specific clue. Clue 4 and 7 are slightly less strong but still related to the answer. No clues contain the answer word.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer, but they are also broad enough to apply to other choices. Clue 1, 'This vague endeavor might encompass intricate calculations, formulas, and abstract ideas to analyze and resolve complicated problems thoroughly,' is related to the idea of strategy and planning, which could apply to some sports, but it's vague enough to also relate to painting or ballet. Clue 2, 'Students dedicate hours to acquire knowledge, analyze information, and expand their understanding of the world.' is a bit more generic, but it could subtly apply to any of the choices by relating to learning and practice. They could be strengthened by adding more subtle connections to sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. Clue 1, 'This presentation includes complex movements, elaborate attire, and captivating expressions of elegance and artistic expertise for audiences,' clearly points to ballet. Clue 2, 'The creation of visual art through various mediums, including painting, sculpture, and digital designs is a focus,' clearly points to painting. Both are strong and effectively mislead the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
