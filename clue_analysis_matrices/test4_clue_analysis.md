## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues are highly specific and closely related to the answer 'Breaking Bad'. Clues like 'The narrative revolves around a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer' (#2) and 'The show features a complex and nuanced portrayal of the main character's transformation' (#4) demonstrate a clear understanding of the show's plot and themes. Clue #8 is also impressive as it highlights the creator's inspiration from real-life events and personal experiences.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Lack of diversity in clue types; Too many generic descriptions in informed clues

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Some misinformed clues, like 'It's a documentary series about the rise and fall of a notorious crime family' (#1), are too vague and might not effectively create productive doubt. However, 'The show primarily focuses on the personal struggles of a character dealing with addiction' (#2) is a good attempt as it partially relates to the show but also leaves room for ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

Fake clues do not clearly point to the other answer choices. For example, 'A historical drama series exploring the lives of a group of people living in the 19th century' (#1) could apply to any historical drama, not just The Sopranos or Narcos. Similarly, 'A crime procedural series following a detective as they solve a series of complex cases' (#2) might fit The Sopranos, but it does not effectively misdirect from Breaking Bad.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
