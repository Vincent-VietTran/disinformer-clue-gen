✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, directly referencing key plot points, themes, and character arcs of 'The Shawshank Redemption' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively isolate the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The misinformed clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. 'The narrative explores the complexities of human relationships and the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment' could apply to many films, but it's not specific enough to plausibly point to 'Titanic' or 'Groundhog Day' in a way that creates confusion with 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Similarly, 'The story focuses on a central relationship that is tested by external forces and personal challenges' is also overly broad.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('The film centers on a love story complicated by social expectations and family disapproval of two people.') strongly points to 'Titanic' without any overlap with 'The Shawshank Redemption'. The second clue ('The plot revolves around a tragic event leading to the loss of a ship and many lives lost at sea.') is a perfect descriptor for 'Titanic' and completely misdirects away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer. However, the misinformed clues are too vague to create significant confusion. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to 'Titanic'. Overall, the balance of difficulty is moderate, leaning towards easy due to the weak misinformed clues.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are strong and specific. The fake clues are excellent for misdirection. The misinformed clues need to be more ambiguous and plausible for the incorrect answers to create better confusion. The difficulty is moderate.
