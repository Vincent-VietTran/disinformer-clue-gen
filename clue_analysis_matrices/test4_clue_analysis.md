## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues are specific and distinct, relating to the actual answer. Clue 1 mentions 'televised programs', Clue 3 mentions 'visual and auditory storytelling elements', and Clue 7 mentions 'episodic content', all of which are specific to TV shows. However, some clues, such as Clue 5, could be slightly more specific to avoid being too generic.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Misinformed clues create ambiguity while staying related to the answer. Clue 1 mentions 'browsing through while flipping channels', which could apply to both TV shows and movies. Clue 2 mentions 'consuming in short bursts', which could apply to TV shows, movies, or books. These clues effectively create doubt without being too misleading.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues clearly misdirect to wrong answer choices. Clue 1 mentions 'interactive entertainment where users can influence the narrative', which points towards a video game or interactive book, not a TV show. Clue 2 mentions 'live performance where actors and actresses improvise lines and actions', which points towards a theater performance, not a TV show. These clues are effective in misdirecting the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues (1-9) are generally well-crafted and specifically relate to 'Breaking Bad'. Clue 1 highlights the transformation of the main character, while clue 5 explores the moral ambiguity. However, some clues, such as clue 7, could be more distinct. Clue 8 effectively conveys the character's downfall, making it a strong informed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues (1-2) attempt to create ambiguity but could be more effective. Clue 1 is somewhat relevant to 'Breaking Bad' but is too vague, applying to many shows. Clue 2 is more convincing in creating doubt, as it relates to themes present in 'Breaking Bad' but also in other series like 'Narcos' or 'The Sopranos'. Improved misinformed clues would more subtly blur the lines between the correct answer and the distractors.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Fake clues (1-2) are effective in misdirecting towards other answer choices. Clue 1 clearly points towards a crime-solving series, which could apply to other shows, not 'Breaking Bad'. Clue 2, while a bit generic, suggests a journey of self-discovery, which is not the primary focus of 'Breaking Bad', thus serving as a good misdirection. However, more distinct and creative fake clues would further enhance the game's challenge.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
