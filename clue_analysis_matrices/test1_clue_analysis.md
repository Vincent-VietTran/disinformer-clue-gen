## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally point to the correct answer, 'movie'. Clue #3 specifically mentions 'genres, such as action, comedy, or drama', which is a distinctive characteristic of movies. However, some clues like #2 are too generic and could apply to other forms of storytelling. Clue #7 is also too short and lacks specificity. Clue #1 is a good description but could be more detailed to better align with the 15-20 word limit.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Some informed clues are too generic

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Misinformed clues create ambiguity by relating to 'book' and 'play', which are both part of the choices. Clue #1 talks about something found in a newspaper or magazine, which could be a book review or a movie listing, thus creating productive doubt. Clue #2 mentions a performance on a stage, which could be a play but also has elements found in some movie productions, effectively blurring the lines.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices. Clue #1 describes interactive entertainment, which could point to a 'book' with interactive elements or a 'play' with audience participation, but does not specifically relate to 'movie'. Clue #2 talks about visual art in a gallery, clearly pointing away from 'movie' towards 'book' or 'play' as types of artistic expressions.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ❌ FAIL |

**Issues Found:** Some informed clues are too generic

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The difficulty is rated as 'just right' because while some clues are straightforward and clearly point towards 'movie', others create ambiguity or misdirect the player, requiring a moderate level of deduction to discern the correct answer. The clues are neither too easy, allowing for immediate identification, nor too hard, causing confusion without any clear path to the answer.

- Generic/vague clues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Address length compliance

3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
Overall, the clues are well-structured to lead to the correct answer, 'movie', with a good balance of direct information, ambiguity, and misdirection.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally relate to the answer and are distinct, but some could be more specific. Clue #1 mentions a 'young protagonist' and a 'particular force', which is a good start.
