## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues (1-9) are specific, distinct, and relate directly to the answer 'Movie'. Clue 1 highlights the visual aspect, clue 2 emphasizes storytelling, and clue 3 mentions cinematic experiences. Each clue provides a unique perspective on what a movie is, making them highly effective in pointing to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Misinformed clues (10-11) create ambiguity by relating to the answer 'Movie' but are vague enough to apply to other choices. Clue 10 could apply to a 'Video Game' or 'Movie', and clue 11 might also relate to 'Video Game' or 'Book'. However, they could be more subtle in their ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues (12-13) effectively misdirect to the wrong answer choices. Clue 12 clearly points to 'Video Game', and clue 13 points to 'Book' or 'Comic', successfully creating misdirection away from 'Movie'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
