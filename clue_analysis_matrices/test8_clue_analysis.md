## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally relate to the answer 'sport' and are distinct. However, clues #2, #3, #5, #6, and #9 could be more specific. Clue #5 is particularly vague as it could apply to many activities beyond sports. Clues #1, #4, #7, and #8 are well-crafted, directly pointing to aspects of sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Lack of diversity in informed clues regarding different types of sports or their unique aspects; Misinformed clues could benefit from more diversity in the types of misleading information provided

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues attempt to create ambiguity but could be more effective. Clue #1 under misinformed clues is somewhat vague but still leans towards being too casual for the sports context. Clue #2, while trying to mislead, still hints at the idea of leisure, which could be related to sports, thus not fully achieving the goal of being misleading.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards the wrong answer choices. Clue #1 suggests an activity that involves puzzle-solving, which is unrelated to sports and more aligned with 'game' or 'hobby'. Clue #2 talks about artistic expression, clearly pointing towards 'hobby' and away from 'sport'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The difficulty level of the clues is 'just right' because they provide a good balance between being straightforward about the nature of sports and requiring some thought to distinguish between the correct answer and the decoys. However, the clues could be made more challenging by introducing more nuanced aspects of sports or by making the misinformed clues slightly more plausible.

**Overall Notes:**  
Overall, the clues demonstrate a good understanding of the answer 'sport' and make an effort to mislead or create ambiguity where necessary. However, improvements can be made in terms of length compliance, specificity of informed clues, and the effectiveness of misinformed clues in creating productive doubt. The fake clues are particularly well-crafted, providing clear misdirection.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally relate to the correct answer, 'Tennis', and provide specific details such as court structure (#1), use of rackets (#2), and scoring system (#7). However, some clues could be more distinct, like #5 which is too brief and generic. Clues #2, #4, and #6 could also be improved with more unique descriptions to better distinguish 'Tennis' from other sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Some informed clues are too similar in content (e.g., #2 and #4 both discuss aspects of gameplay without distinguishing features).; Misinformed clues could be more diverse in the types of ambiguity they create.

### Misinformed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Misinformed clues are effective in creating ambiguity related to 'Tennis' while being vague enough to apply to other sports like 'Golf' or 'Volleyball'. For example, clue #1 talks about riding a vehicle, which could misleadingly relate to 'Golf' carts, and clue #2 mentions a large open area, which could apply to several sports, thus successfully creating productive doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Fake clues generally misdirect towards other answer choices, not 'Tennis'. Clue #1 involves navigating an obstacle course, which doesn't relate to 'Tennis', and clue #2 talks about teamwork, which, while partially true for doubles in 'Tennis', is more universally applicable to team sports like 'Volleyball', thus providing effective misdirection. However, they could be made more convincing by directly referencing aspects unique to the wrong choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
