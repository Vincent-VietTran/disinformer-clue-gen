## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Most informed clues are specific and distinct, but some (e.g. clue 5) are too generic. Clue 3 is well-written, but clue 9 is very similar to clue 3. Clue 1 and clue 7 are well-written, but clue 2 is a bit too vague. Clue 4 and clue 8 are similar, but clue 6 is different and well-written. Overall, most clues show good specificity, but some need improvement.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- fake clues are not diverse in terms of misdirection

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues #1 and #2 are somewhat effective in creating ambiguity, but they could be more vague. They are still related to the answer, but the language is not ambiguous enough to apply to multiple choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

Fake clues #1 and #2 are not effective in misdirecting to the wrong answer choices. Clue #1 is actually a good description of the answer, and clue #2 is too vague to be effective in misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Most informed clues are well-structured and specific to the correct answer. However, clue #6 seems to describe a general scenario that could apply to multiple sports, which reduces its specificity. Clue #1 and #2 are very similar, which might make them redundant.

- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Some informed clues describe similar scenarios, reducing diversity in clue types

**Fair - Below expectations**

Misinformed clues do not effectively create ambiguity, as clue #1 is directly related to football, which is not a sport related to the answer. Clue #2 mentions teamwork, which could be a characteristic of multiple sports. To improve, misinformed clues should be more vague and unrelated to the actual answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 3/5

Clue #2 in fake clues describes a team activity, which could also apply to multiple sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
