**Compliance Rate:** 21% (3/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 11/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 12.9 words

**Assessment:** ❌ Critical - Significant length violations require revision

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally point to the correct answer 'sport' specifically, but some clues such as #1, #3, #5, and #6 could be more distinct. Clue #7 is too short and lacks specificity. Clues #4, #8, and #9 are well-crafted, providing a clear connection to the answer without being too generic.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Lack of diversity in clue lengths; Some clues lack specificity

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues attempt to create ambiguity but could be more effective. Clue #1 is too vague and could apply to any of the choices, while clue #2 seems unrelated to 'sport' and more aligned with 'music' or 'dance', which is not ideal for creating productive doubt related to 'sport'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Fake clues effectively misdirect to the wrong answer choices. Both clues clearly point away from 'sport', with one suggesting a type of food and the other a form of meditation, which could misleadingly point towards 'music' or other unrelated concepts.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Main Issues:**
- Word count compliance issues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues
- Missing specificity in clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Address length compliance
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality

**Overall Notes:**  
The clue set shows promise but requires refinement in terms of length compliance and specificity. Informed clues are generally strong but could benefit from more distinct descriptions. Misinformed clues need to walk a finer line between ambiguity and relevance to the correct answer, while fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards incorrect choices. Adjusting clue lengths and improving specificity will enhance the overall quality of the clue set.

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally provide specific and distinct information about the answer, 'Tennis'. Clues #1, #5, #6, and #7 are particularly effective in this regard.
