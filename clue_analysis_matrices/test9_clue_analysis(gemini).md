# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 9 | Round 1: Country → Japan**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific and distinct, clearly pointing to the definition of a country. They avoid using the word 'country' itself. The mention of geographical borders, population, government, and international recognition are good indicators.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the idea of a country in a very abstract way (e.g., 'understanding the physical universe' could be related to geography, or 'narrative structures' to national identity), but they are vague enough to apply to other choices like 'continent' or 'city' if one stretches the definition. The ambiguity is reasonably effective, creating some confusion without being completely random.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues point towards activities or fields of study that are not directly related to the concept of a country, a city or a continent. 'Constructing buildings' and 'studying ancient civilizations' are related, but not directly, and therefore serve as good misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
