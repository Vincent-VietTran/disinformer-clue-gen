# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 9 | Round 1: Country → Japan**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.8 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific to 'country' by referencing borders, inhabitants, culture, and traditions. They avoid using the word 'country'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The 'misinformed' clues about music are related to the answer (countries have music). They are vague enough that they don't immediately suggest 'country' but also don't completely miss the mark, creating some productive ambiguity. Could be better, leaning a little too heavily on easily identifiable music tropes.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues successfully point to the wrong choices. The first clue is about movies. The second clue is about books. They are believable and avoid any hint of the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific and avoid using 'Japan'. They highlight cultural contrasts and the archipelago nature of the location, both strongly linked to Japan.

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5
