## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific and distinct, avoiding the word 'country' while clearly pointing to the concept of a sovereign state. They effectively highlight characteristics like boundaries, government, population, culture, and traditions, which are key differentiators.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the concept of a country, but are vague enough to apply to multiple choices. The clues focus on experiences and collections of items, which can be found in a city or continent too. The ambiguity is productive.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues effectively misdirect the player to the WRONG choices. They focus on dreams, aspirations, and communities, which are more closely associated with a city or continent. These avoid the concept of a sovereign state.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are highly specific to Japan: ancient traditions, modern tech, and distinct cuisine (sushi, ramen). No answer contamination. Very distinct.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to Japan (trade/purchasing and sports events), but are vague enough to apply to China or Italy. The ambiguity is decent, not too obvious or vague.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues clearly misdirect away from Japan. The grasslands and wildlife suggest China (or potentially Italy, depending on interpretation), and the diverse cultures could apply to either China or Italy, but not Japan. Effective misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
