# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 7 | Round 1: Animal → African Elephant**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.3 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are specific and distinct, pointing directly to the 'animal' answer without using the word. They highlight key characteristics like nervous systems, emotions, and behavioral diversity.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are related to 'animal' (living room could hint at a pet, forest at habitat) but are vague enough to apply to 'tool' (living room) or 'mineral' (forest). They create productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues clearly point to the wrong answer choices. One relates to communication, likely leading to 'tool', and the other to construction, likely leading to 'mineral'. They avoid any mention of animals.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
