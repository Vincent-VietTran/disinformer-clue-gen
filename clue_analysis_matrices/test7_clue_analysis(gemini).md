# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 7 | Round 1: Animal → African Elephant**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.7 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are specific and well-paraphrased, avoiding direct synonyms or the answer word. They cover various aspects of the 'animal' classification without being too obvious. The variety of phrasing offers distinct angles.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues create productive ambiguity. The library clue has a tangential connection (classification/study) but misdirects to 'mineral' or a general concept of information. The garden clue strongly misdirects to 'plant' while having a weak thematic link to living organisms.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues effectively misdirect. The gallery clue strongly points to 'mineral' (sculptures, gems) or even 'plant' (floral arrangements). The sky clue points to 'plant' (seeds carried by wind) or a very abstract interpretation of 'mineral' (meteors) but has no link to 'animal'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are specific and varied, covering physical attributes, behavior, habitat, and conservation status without using forbidden words. They clearly point to the African Elephant.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues for 'Tiger' have some thematic overlap (predator, hunting) but are not strongly misleading. The clue about 'icy landscapes' is completely off for both the Tiger and African Elephant, making it less effective as a misdirection within the context of the actual answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues for 'Tiger' and 'Giant Panda' are plausible descriptions for those animals and effectively misdirect away from the African Elephant, as they describe different characteristics and habitats. The 'icy landscapes' clue for the Tiger is a weak misdirection for the African Elephant but could be intended to mislead towards a polar bear if that were a choice. The 'lives in trees' and 'near water' clues for the Panda are good misdirections.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and meet all criteria. The misinformed and fake clues are generally good, though the 'icy landscapes' clue for the Tiger is a bit of an outlier and doesn't strongly connect to any of the provided choices in a misdirecting way. The overall difficulty is well-balanced.
