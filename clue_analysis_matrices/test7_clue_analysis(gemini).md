## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally good and specific. Clue 1, 'These large mammals are known for their massive ears, which they use to regulate body temperature in the heat.' is a strong and specific clue. Clue 2 is also strong. Clue 4, 'Their tusks are made of ivory, which has led to widespread poaching and endangerment of these creatures.' is excellent. Clue 6 is great, mentioning communication methods. Clue 7, about diet, is good. Clue 8 is good about ecosystem impact. Clue 9 mentions intelligence. However, some clues could be slightly more specific to avoid overlap with other large mammals. All clues are relevant and accurate.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat weak. Clue 1, 'These creatures are often portrayed in fantastical stories, possessing magical abilities and engaging in epic quests.' is not that answer-related. Clue 2, 'The subject is typically associated with a long neck, and their distinctive appearance makes them instantly recognizable to all.' is better, but still vague. It is not specific enough to create productive doubt, and could apply to many animals. More connection to the answer, but still vague, is needed.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. Clue 1, 'This creature is often featured in animated films, known for its playful nature and ability to speak and sing beautifully.' This is a great misdirection. Clue 2, 'This African creature, with its exceptionally long neck, gracefully consumes leaves from towering treetops within its natural habitat.' clearly directs to the Giraffe in the choices. These are very good and well-targeted fake clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
