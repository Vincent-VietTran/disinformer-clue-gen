**Test Run 7 | Round 1: Animal → African Elephant**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.9 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1 is excellent in its description. Clue 3 is a solid general definition. Clue 5 is a bit more scientific but still relevant. Clue 9 is good because it highlights behavior. All the clues successfully avoid using the answer word. Some clues (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10) are a bit more generic, but they still point towards 'animal'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Clue 1 of the misinformed set is related to the answer (animals are consumed), but it's very vague and could apply to plants as well. Clue 2 is very weak. It is difficult to see how complex systems of animals could be used for aesthetic purposes. These clues do introduce some ambiguity but don't effectively create doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues effectively misdirect away from the correct answer. Clue 1 points towards 'plant' (transporting fluids and nutrients) and Clue 2 also points to 'plant' (creating products like paper and textiles).

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong and specific to African Elephants. Clue 1, referencing large ears for temperature regulation, is excellent. Clue 2 on social structures and matriarchs is also good. Clue 3 on tusks is accurate. Clue 4 regarding diet is good. Clue 5 on being the largest land animal is accurate. Clue 6 regarding intelligence and communication is solid. Clue 7 on ecosystem role is relevant. Clue 8 on gestation period is also good. Clue 9 referencing habitat is strong. Clue 10 on the trunk is perfect. All clues are clear and specific enough to point towards the answer, though some like 5 could apply to the Woolly Mammoth, if not for the other clues. No clues contain the answer word, which is good. There is good diversity across the clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat weak. Clue 1, about being located in colder regions, is a decent misdirection, but could be stronger. Clue 2 about building structures is not relevant to any of the choices, making it a bit less effective. They are answer-related, but not very ambiguous.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1, about flying, completely misdirects away from any of the choices. Clue 2, about aquatic environments, also misdirects effectively, as none of the choices are aquatic. These are very effective at steering the player away from the answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
