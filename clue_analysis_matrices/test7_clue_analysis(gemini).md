## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are good and descriptive, avoiding direct answer words. They focus on suspense, tension, and high stakes, which are strong indicators of 'Thriller'. There's a slight overlap with 'Mystery' in clue 8, but the overall emphasis leans heavily towards suspense and intensity.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues effectively blend elements that could apply to 'Action' and 'Mystery' while subtly hinting at 'Thriller'. Clue 1 points towards 'Action' with explosions and fighting, but the 'forces of evil' could also be a threat in a thriller. Clue 2 points strongly to 'Mystery' with detectives and solving cases, but mysteries can also be suspenseful and tense, fitting a thriller.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirections. Clue 1 strongly suggests 'Sci-Fi' or 'Drama' with its focus on complex characters and philosophical themes. Clue 2 points directly to 'Sci-Fi' with advanced technology and space battles. Neither has any connection to 'Thriller' or 'Mystery'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively capturing the core concepts and plot elements of 'Inception' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover the dream-sharing, subconscious manipulation, layered realities, the protagonist's personal struggles, and the famous ambiguous ending, all pointing directly to 'Inception'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues create a moderate level of ambiguity. The 'brilliant detective' clue is a good misdirection for 'Sherlock Holmes', but the 'suave British spy' clue for 'James Bond' is quite distinct. The connection to 'Inception' is subtle, relying on the idea of complex missions, but not strong enough to be confusing.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirection. The 'master detective' clue strongly points to 'Sherlock Holmes' and is completely unrelated to 'Inception'. The 'protagonist embarks on dangerous missions' clue, while generally applicable to action films, is clearly designed to evoke 'James Bond' and has no connection to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
