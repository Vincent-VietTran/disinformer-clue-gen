## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5

The misinformed clues relate to the concept of information sources and creation, which could vaguely relate to all choices. The vagueness is present, but could be more subtly connected to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues directly point to 'building' and 'clothing', effectively misdirecting the player. They are believable and distinct.
