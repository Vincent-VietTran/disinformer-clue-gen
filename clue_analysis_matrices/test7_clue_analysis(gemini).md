## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific to animals, focusing on biological characteristics and behaviors, avoiding the word 'animal'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the concept of 'life' or 'information storage' which could apply to both plants and animals, creating some ambiguity, but they lean more towards a plant-like concept (books).

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues clearly point away from 'animal' by referring to abstract concepts like 'entity' or 'fictional characters' which are more strongly associated with the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
