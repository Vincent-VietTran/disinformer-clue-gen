**Test Run 1 | Round 1: Movie → Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.7 words

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are specific and distinct, directly referencing visual entertainment and storytelling through moving images, avoiding the word 'movie'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are related to the correct answer (films can be found in libraries, and used in classrooms), but are vague enough to also apply to 'song' (e.g., musical scores can be in libraries) and 'poem' (poems are in classrooms and books). They create productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues directly point to the incorrect choices. One refers to musical compositions (song) and the other to carefully chosen words (poem). Neither relates to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
