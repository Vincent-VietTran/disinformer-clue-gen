## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are fairly specific and avoid direct answer contamination. Midi-chlorian count is a good distinct angle. The queen/trade blockade clue is also helpful.

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to fantasy/adventure but are too generic. The ring clue is too specific to LOTR, and the wizardry clue is too specific to Harry Potter. They don't create enough productive ambiguity with the Star Wars choice.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
