**Average Word Count:** 17.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and avoid any direct mention of 'Sci-Fi' or its synonyms. They effectively describe the core elements of the genre from various angles, such as technology, future, space, ethics, and societal structures, all without hinting at Horror or Fantasy. The language is precise and descriptive.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues create good ambiguity. The first misinformed clue about 'supernatural elements, jump scares, and psychological thrillers' strongly points to Horror, but the mention of 'terrify audiences' could subtly tie into some darker Sci-Fi themes if one stretches it. The second clue about 'mythical beings, magical systems, and momentous conflicts' clearly points to Fantasy, but the phrase 'environments of fantasy and imagination' could be loosely interpreted to include the imaginative worlds often built in Sci-Fi. They blend a partial truth (imagination) with a clear misdirection to other genres.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue ('terrifying creatures, suspenseful plots, and a focus on the darker side of human nature') is a classic description of Horror and avoids any Sci-Fi elements. The second clue ('wizards, dragons, and quests in a world where magic and mythical beings exist') is a perfect description of Fantasy and completely excludes Sci-Fi. They are designed to strongly and plausibly describe the incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong enough to make the correct answer clear to someone familiar with the genres. The misinformed clues provide just enough overlap or creative interpretation to make the player think, but not so much that it becomes confusing or impossible to deduce the correct answer. The fake clues are distinct enough not to cause confusion with the correct answer. This feels like a well-balanced difficulty.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The clues are well-crafted, with highly specific and non-contaminated informed clues. The misinformed clues offer productive ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect to incorrect choices. The difficulty is appropriate for a game.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, covering plot, themes, visual style, and iconic elements without using any forbidden words. They effectively isolate 'The Matrix'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues are good. They start with a plausible but incorrect premise ('paranormal investigators', 'fellowship on a perilous quest') and then pivot to elements that *could* be vaguely associated with the correct answer if one wasn't paying close attention, but are clearly meant to point to the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent. They directly and strongly describe the incorrect choices ('haunted house', 'powerful artifact') and are completely unrelated to the correct answer, providing strong misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
