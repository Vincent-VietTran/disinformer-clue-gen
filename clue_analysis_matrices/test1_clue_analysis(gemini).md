## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. They provide specific details about movies and are mostly distinct. Clue 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are all very good, focusing on visual entertainment, storytelling, and the production process. Clue 4 is slightly less strong, as it could apply to other forms of art. Clue 9 is good, covering the diversity of genres. No clues contain the answer word, which is good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat effective. Clue 1, referring to libraries or bookstores, vaguely connects to a movie's source material (books). Clue 2, referencing classrooms, is less effective, as movies are rarely made or shown in classrooms. They could be improved by leaning into a more tangential connection. The clues are related to the answer but could be more ambiguous to other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 clearly points to 'song' by describing musical compositions. Clue 2 clearly points to 'poem', describing written words for an audience. They are both highly effective at misdirecting the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1 is a good starting point, hinting at the key themes. Clue 2 is also good, mentioning space battles and mysticism. Clue 3 mentions political intrigue and alliances, which is relevant to the answer. Clue 4 is helpful, focusing on the Queen. Clue 5 is slightly more general, but still points towards the answer. Clue 6, 7 and 8 provide more specific details. Clue 9 is also good, referencing the broader themes. All clues help narrow down the answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer's genre but are sufficiently vague to apply to multiple choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 directly references high school life, love, loss, and drama, which points away from all the answer choices. Clue 2 is about detective work, which is completely unrelated to the answer choices. These provide effective misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
