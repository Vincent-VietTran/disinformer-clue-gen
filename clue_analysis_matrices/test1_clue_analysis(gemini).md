## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong, providing specific details about movies. Clue 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 are all very good, specifying details like 'moving pictures,' 'cinematography,' 'collaborative efforts,' and 'genre.' Clue 4 is a bit generic ('source of education, inspiration, and escape') and could apply to other forms of media. Clue 6 is okay but could be more specific to movies (e.g., 'typical screenplay structure').

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer but not specific enough to the correct answer. Clue 1 points to something like a novel, while clue 2 is more vague and could apply to any writing.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 clearly points to a 'collection of musical compositions' and Clue 2 directly describes a 'stage performance,' effectively misdirecting the player towards the incorrect choices (poem, painting).

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally good, providing specific details related to 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'. Clue 1, 'A young boy's destiny is foretold, setting the stage for galactic conflicts across vast interstellar distances,' is a strong opener. Clue 4, 'It features a podrace, a high-speed competition highlighting the thrill of competition and the need for speed,' is particularly effective due to its specificity. Clue 6, 'The movie introduces a character who is a skilled warrior and a key player in the coming galactic conflicts,' is a bit vague but still related. The clues effectively describe the movie's plot, characters, and setting. No clues contain the answer directly. The descriptions are generally distinct enough, although some could be slightly more specific to avoid overlap with other Star Wars movies.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat ambiguous but could apply to other movies. Clue 1, 'The story centers on a young man's journey to overcome personal challenges and achieve his dreams in life,' is very generic and could fit many movies. Clue 2, 'This is a tale of a group of friends who embark on a thrilling adventure filled with mysteries and wonders,' is also vague. They're related to the general themes, but not uniquely to the target movie, thus creating productive doubt. They are not strongly related to the specific plot of the movie.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting towards the other choices. Clue 1, 'The film tells the tale of a lone warrior who battles against a tyrannical empire in a dystopian future,' could easily point to Avatar or Inception but not the correct answer. Clue 2, 'This tale chronicles a group's cross-country journey, exploring themes of friendship, self-discovery, and the unpredictable nature of travel and adventure,' clearly doesn't fit the Star Wars theme at all and misdirects strongly. These are very effective at guiding the user towards the wrong answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
