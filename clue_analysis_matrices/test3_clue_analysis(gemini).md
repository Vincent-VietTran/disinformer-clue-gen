## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Both samples are specific to the correct answer. They avoid mentioning the title directly but hint at key elements: orphaned boy, magical school. Could be slightly more distinct but are effective.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The first misinformed clue could apply to 'The Hunger Games' (high school drama is a stretch but possible) and 'Pride and Prejudice' (complex relationships). The second is too specific to 'The Hunger Games' and doesn't mislead towards 'Pride and Prejudice'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues effectively point away from the correct answer. The first hints at a historical setting, which doesn't fit any of the choices but leans away from the correct answer. The second leans away from the correct answer. They are believable and misdirect well.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
