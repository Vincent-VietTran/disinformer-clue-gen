## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific and highlight the unique aspects of a book, such as the use of imagination and vivid descriptions, without using the word 'book'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to storytelling and engagement, which could vaguely apply to all options, but the specific details about movement, sets, and costumes lean more towards 'Movie' than 'Book' or 'Podcast', so the ambiguity isn't perfect.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues effectively point towards 'Movie' (visual medium, moving images) and 'Podcast' (audio entertainment, sound effects), while avoiding any connection to 'Book'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
