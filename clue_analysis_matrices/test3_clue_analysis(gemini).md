## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are specific to 'book', avoiding the word itself. They highlight key characteristics like being found in libraries, containing pages, words, and illustrations, and being a source of knowledge and escape.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are related to the concept of stories and diverse experiences, which could apply to a book, a movie, or a song, creating effective ambiguity without being overly vague. They don't give away the answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues clearly point towards the wrong answers. One points to a 'song' with mention of instruments and dancing, while the other refers to 'movie' with actors performing on stage. They avoid any mention of books.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
