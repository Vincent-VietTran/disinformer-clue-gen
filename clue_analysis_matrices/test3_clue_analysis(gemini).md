# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 3 | Round 1: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, focusing on physical conflict, daring feats, and high-energy sequences without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They clearly point towards 'Action'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues effectively blend elements that could be associated with 'Action' (dangerous perils) with stronger leanings towards 'Thriller' (stalked by a figure, dread) and 'Adventure' (treacherous landscapes, hidden treasure). This creates productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They completely avoid 'Action' and strongly and plausibly describe 'Thriller' (psychological torment, battlefield of the mind) and 'Adventure' (wonder, exploration, exotic locales, ancient artifacts), providing strong misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, providing precise and varied descriptions that strongly indicate 'Action' without any contamination. The misinformed clues offer good ambiguity by partially overlapping with 'Action' but leaning towards other genres. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Thriller' and 'Adventure'. The set is well-balanced and meets all criteria.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using any forbidden words. They cover visual style, narrative themes, setting, and iconic elements like the chase sequences and vehicle modifications. Each clue points strongly and uniquely to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues create good ambiguity. The first clue about an archaeologist and a desert quest subtly points to 'Indiana Jones' while still having a vague connection to the desolate setting of the correct answer. The second clue about a killer and suspense directly misdirects towards 'Psycho'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue perfectly describes 'Psycho' with its focus on a disturbed individual and stalking. The second clue strongly points to 'Indiana Jones' with its mention of a quest for hidden treasure and adventure, completely avoiding any connection to 'Mad Max: Fury Road'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Psycho' and 'Indiana Jones' respectively, fulfilling their deceptive purpose. The overall quality of clues is high, leading to a balanced difficulty.
