## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are reasonably specific to episodic narratives and character development over time, which are strong aspects of TV shows. They avoid using the answer word directly and offer distinct angles.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues relate to storytelling and information presentation, which could apply to all options to some extent, but they are slightly more aligned with books. The ambiguity is decent but could be stronger.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues clearly point away from 'TV Show' and towards 'Song' and something more general (Theatre, but implying not book). They are believable red herrings.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific and well-crafted, avoiding direct mention of the answer. The cancer diagnosis and Albuquerque setting are strong identifiers. They could be slightly more diverse in their focus; both relate to plot/setting.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are reasonably ambiguous, relating to common tropes in TV dramas (friendship, survival). However, they could be more subtly connected to the specific choices to increase the effectiveness of the misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues effectively point to other types of shows. Miami police procedural is a good misdirect for The Sopranos (crime drama). British royal family is a good misdirect to none of these but is still generally well done.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
