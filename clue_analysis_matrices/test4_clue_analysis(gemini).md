| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues are excellent. They avoid answer contamination and are highly specific to TV Shows. They cover different aspects, from structure (clue 1) to distribution (clue 2) to genre (clue 5) to production (clue 6) to impact (clue 9). They build a strong case for the answer. 

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the answer (communication and written content) but are too generic. Clue 1 could apply to almost anything, and clue 2 is vague. They create some ambiguity but could be improved to specifically hint at the *form* of TV Show rather than general communication.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They are very clear misdirections. Clue 1 points to 'Movie' with video clips and sound, and clue 2 points to 'Book' with artistic expression and the telling of stories. They directly address the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the answer clear, but the misinformed clues add a layer of doubt and create some difficulty. The fake clues are well-placed to mislead the player. The difficulty is high because of the balance between the clarity of the informed clues and the vagueness of the misinformed clues.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Word count compliance issues
- Missing specificity in clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The clues are well-constructed overall. The informed and fake clues are very effective. The misinformed clues could be improved to be more ambiguous while remaining relevant. The length and specificity requirements are met.

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong and specific to Breaking Bad. Clue 1 (transformation) and clue 8 (greed, power) are particularly good, hitting key themes. Clue 4 (desert landscape) is a good example of specificity. Clue 6 (cliffhangers) is also very effective. Clue 9 (character portrayals) is slightly more generic, but still relevant. Clue 3 (symbolism) is good. Clue 2 (desperate circumstances) and clue 5 (family dynamics) are a little generic, but still fit.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to the general themes of the choices, making them somewhat ambiguous. Clue 1 (teenagers/mystical powers) could apply to The Wire or The Sopranos, though it's less fitting. Clue 2 (friends in a small community) is vague enough to potentially fit any of the choices, creating productive doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues effectively misdirect. Clue 1 (love and loss) is generic enough to apply to any show, but not specific. Clue 2 (thrilling adventures) is similar, and the explicit statement that it's not the correct answer is a good touch to ensure misdirection. They don't relate to Breaking Bad at all.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
