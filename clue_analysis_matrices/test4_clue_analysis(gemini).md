**Test Run 4 | Round 1: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.9 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the chosen answer without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like emotional depth, conflict, realism, and thematic exploration, providing distinct angles. No answer contamination detected.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues effectively blend a partial truth (humor, amusement) with misdirection towards 'Comedy'. The mention of 'lighthearted stories' and 'funny moments' creates ambiguity, making it a productive confusion as it doesn't directly contradict the core of 'Drama' but steers away from its serious and intense aspects.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Romance' ('love, passion, emotional connections') and then pivot to 'Comedy' ('lighthearted narratives with humor, aiming to entertain and amuse'). They completely avoid any connection to 'Drama' and are highly deceptive.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer identifiable.

The fake clues are also well-crafted to misdirect effectively.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The clues are well-balanced. The informed clues are precise and avoid contamination. The misinformed clues introduce productive ambiguity by blending elements of the correct answer with another choice. The fake clues are highly deceptive and effectively target incorrect choices. The overall difficulty is moderate, making it a good challenge.

The ambiguity is productive.

⚠️ Concerns:

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**
