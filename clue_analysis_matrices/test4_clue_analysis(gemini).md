## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong, providing specific characteristics of TV shows. Clue 1 mentions 'recurring characters' and 'weekly episodes,' which are distinct. Clue 2 focuses on the visual medium with 'moving images, sound, and dialogue.' Clue 3 mentions 'multiple seasons' and 'complex character development.' Clue 4 highlights global accessibility. Clue 5 references diverse genres. Clue 6 focuses on convenience. Clue 7 mentions 'large audience and critical acclaim.' Clue 8 mentions 'social issues' and 'human relationships.' Clue 9 mentions 'cultural trends.' All clues are well-written and relevant. No clues contain the answer word. The clues are slightly repetitive but still effective. Could have included more details about specific types of TV shows or how they are made.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat effective in creating ambiguity. Clue 1, referring to 'artwork' with 'still images,' could apply to a movie or even a TV show with artistic visuals, but is too vague. Clue 2, mentioning 'shelves of a library,' could apply to books, as intended. Both clues are related but the first one is weaker. The clues succeed in casting doubt on the correct answer. Both clues are too vague.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. Clue 1, describing 'words printed on pages,' clearly points to 'book.' Clue 2, referencing 'moving pictures, often shown in theaters,' clearly points to 'movie.' These are effective and well-written.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong. Clue 1 is a good starting point, focusing on transformation. Clue 2 is very specific, mentioning the profession and product. Clue 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are all solid, referencing key themes and plot elements of Breaking Bad. Clue 6, mentioning the setting, is also helpful. All clues avoid using the answer word. Some clues (e.g., 3, 8) could be slightly more specific to Breaking Bad to avoid overlap with other shows.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are somewhat effective. Clue 1 mentions New York and fashion, which could potentially mislead towards The Sopranos, but the connection is a bit tenuous. Clue 2 about zombies has no clear connection to the answer or other choices, so is not a good misinformer. The clues do create a bit of productive doubt by relating to themes that could be present in other shows.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. Clue 1 perfectly describes a detective show, moving the player towards Game of Thrones. Clue 2 describes a sitcom, which doesn't fit any of the choices, but is a very clear misdirection. Both clues are distinct from Breaking Bad and the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
