- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Informed clues are mostly similar in style, only #6 is different

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

INFORMED CLUES: Most clues are specific and accurate. However, clues #1, 3, 7, and 9 contain overly generic descriptions that could apply to similar animals. Clue #9 also implies that the animal's size is a unique adaptation, but this is not entirely accurate. Clue #7 could be improved with more specificity about the sense of smell's role in the wild.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- answer contamination in informed clues

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

MISINFORMED CLUES: Clue #1 is too specific and implies speed and agility in open spaces, which is more characteristic of the Cheetah. Clue #2 is vague and could apply to multiple animals adapted to cold climates. However, it does create some doubt and might not be immediately dismissible.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

FAKE CLUES: Clue #1 clearly points to the Lion as the big cat in question. However, Clue #2 is somewhat misleading as it references the ability to change color, which is a characteristic of the Chameleon, but not the other choices. The clue could be improved to more clearly misdirect to the wrong answer choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
