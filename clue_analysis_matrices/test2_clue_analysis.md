## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Informed clues are highly specific, effectively pointing to the correct answer. Clues #1-10 are all well-written and distinct. However, some clues could be tightened for better clarity.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- fake_clues #1 has strong relation to other answer choice 'novel, short film, song'

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues attempt to create ambiguity, but some descriptions are too vague or generic. Clue #2 'It's a type of music that emphasizes the use of electronic instruments and synthesizers' is too narrow (it specifically rules out other electronic genres) instead of being vague enough. Clues #3 and #4 'It's a style of music characterized by its fast-paced rhythms and energetic live performances' and 'It's a genre of music that focuses on the use of acoustic instruments and traditional songwriting techniques' could be rewritten to be more ambiguous.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

Fake clues aim to misdirect, but some are too obvious or closely related to the correct answer. Clue #1 'It's a type of music that originated in the 19th century, characterized by its use of classical instruments' is too closely related to the actual answer. Clue #2 'It's a genre of music that emphasizes the use of spoken word and storytelling' is too vague and could apply to many genres.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
