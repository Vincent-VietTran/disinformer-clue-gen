## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues are generally well-crafted, specifically clue 3 'It swiftly conveys snapshots you replay in your mind instead of reading them on pages.' and clue 7 'Lyrics often explore themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery in a poetic manner.' effectively point to the correct answer. However, some clues like clue 1 'A form of musical expression that evokes emotions through melody and harmonious vocal tones together.' could be more specific.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues create some ambiguity but could be more effective. Clue 9 'It's something you might carefully browse over your morning coffee while relaxing peacefully at home.' and clue 10 'A form of entertainment that can be enjoyed in a variety of settings and contexts always.' are somewhat related to the answer but not vague enough to apply to multiple choices, thus not creating enough productive doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues are effective in misdirecting to wrong answer choices. Clue 11 'Words printed on pages bound together tell stories across centuries and inspire human imagination deeply.' clearly points to 'poem' or 'short story', and clue 12 'Visual scenes displayed on screens create narratives showing characters acting in dramatic situations throughout films.' points to none of the given choices but is a good misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Informed clues (1-8) are highly specific and accurately describe 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen, with details such as operatic vocals, complex harmonies, and a groundbreaking music video. Clue 3 highlights the song's composition, while clue 5 notes the operatic section's technicality. These clues effectively distinguish the correct answer from other options.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Misinformed clues (1-2) create ambiguity by describing a song about overcoming mistakes or featuring a simple melody, which could apply to multiple choices. However, they may not be vague enough to fully create productive doubt, as clue 1 still hints at themes of redemption found in 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
