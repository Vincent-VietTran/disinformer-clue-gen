### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Both misinformed clues are related to the answer but are vague enough to apply to multiple choices. They aim to create doubt, but could be stronger. 
Clue 1: Could apply to a movie or even a song (if it's a 'story song' or has a visual component through a music video). 
Clue 2: Applies to movies, but could also be interpreted as a song by some. The vagueness is good to create productive doubt.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues successfully point to the other choices. They are clearly about 'book' and 'movie'.
Clue 1: Perfectly describes a book.
Clue 2: Perfectly describes a movie.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are generally strong and specific. Clue 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 are particularly strong, focusing on the song's unique structure, vocal harmonies, genre-blending, theatrical performance, dynamic changes and innovative creation. Clue 2 is a bit more generic, as existential themes can apply to many songs. Clue 4 is somewhat generic as well. Clue 8 is a good clue, but could be more specific. No clues contain the answer directly.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are related to music but not specific enough to the correct answer. Clue 1 is related to a royalty, which does not fit. Clue 2 is a fantasy theme, which could potentially apply to other songs. Both clues create some level of productive doubt, but could be more closely related to the *feel* of the song (e.g., a clue about a romantic story).

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting towards the other answer choices. Clue 1 could easily describe a love song (e.g., Hotel California) and Clue 2 is a dance-oriented song (e.g., Hotel California). They are both very effective in their misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong, but not all are immediately obvious without some knowledge of the song. The misinformed clues add some ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect. This combination of factors makes the round challenging but solvable for someone familiar with the song, or with a good understanding of music. The clues should be difficult but not impossible to solve.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Word count compliance issues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
This is a well-constructed round with strong informed clues, effective misinformed clues, and excellent fake clues. The length and format requirements are met. The round offers a good balance of difficulty and misdirection. The round is effective.
