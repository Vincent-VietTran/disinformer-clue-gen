## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All informed clues are excellent. They are specific to songs and avoid being overly generic. Clue 1 highlights structure, clue 2 discusses performance, clue 3 focuses on musical elements, clue 4 on expression, clue 5 on lyrics, clue 6 on rhythm, clue 7 on harmony, clue 8 on genres and clue 9 on platforms. All avoid the word 'song'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are decent. Clue 1 could apply to a song if one considers a library of sheet music, but is more strongly associated with novels. Clue 2 could be about a song, but is more closely associated with movies. They are related to the answer but can also apply to other choices, creating some ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both fake clues are highly effective. Clue 1 directly points to 'movie' with the mention of moving pictures and cinema screens. Clue 2 points to 'novel' with 'written or spoken format' and the idea of sharing thoughts and ideas, a key aspect of storytelling.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
