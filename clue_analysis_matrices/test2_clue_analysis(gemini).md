## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are specific and use varied language to describe the essence of a song without using the word 'song' or direct synonyms. They cover aspects like structure, purpose, and performance.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues effectively use partial truths. 'Displayed on pages' and 'found in libraries or bookstores' strongly point to 'novel'. The clue about 'visual art form' and 'moving images' points to 'movie'. There's a subtle connection to 'song' through the idea of 'conveying ideas' and 'telling a story', but the primary misdirection is strong.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue perfectly describes a 'novel', and the second perfectly describes a 'movie'. Neither has any overlap with 'song'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues effectively describe the unique structure and musical elements of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without using direct keywords. They highlight the operatic passages, hard rock climax, complex harmonies, varied styles, innovative structure, and blend of genres. The clues are specific enough to point strongly to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues create some ambiguity. The first clue about 'treasure' is completely unrelated to any of the choices. The second clue about a 'repetitive chorus and simple verses' is misleading as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is known for its complexity, not simplicity. However, 'Hotel California' and 'Yesterday' have more straightforward structures and choruses, so it could lead to confusion, but not strongly enough to be highly productive.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are effective. The first clue about 'unwavering love' and 'enduring romance' strongly points to 'Yesterday' by The Beatles, which is a well-known love song. The second clue about a 'high-energy anthem about never giving up' could plausibly apply to 'Hotel California' (though not its primary theme) or even 'Bohemian Rhapsody' in its rock sections, but it's more aligned with a general anthem feel that 'Yesterday' lacks. The key is that they steer away from the specific operatic and structural elements of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, but the complexity of the song's description prevents it from being too easy. The misinformed and fake clues add a layer of misdirection that requires careful consideration of the options.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are strong and descriptive, accurately capturing the essence of 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without revealing the answer. The fake clues effectively misdirect to other options, particularly 'Yesterday'. The misinformed clues could be slightly improved for more productive ambiguity, but overall, the set is well-balanced.
