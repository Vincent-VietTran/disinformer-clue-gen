---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All clues are highly specific to the concept of generating amusement through humor, avoiding any direct mention of the answer word or its direct synonyms. They cover various aspects like writing, character, timing, and the explicit goal of eliciting laughter.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues effectively blend elements that could *potentially* overlap with the correct answer (e.g., 'narrative' or 'captivate the audience') but strongly steer towards other genres ('intense human conflicts', 'explosions, chases, and intense combat sequences'). They create a good level of ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They directly and plausibly describe 'Drama' and 'Action' respectively, using terms like 'serious topics', 'human nature', 'societal issues', 'fast-paced action', 'thrilling stunts', and 'intense fight scenes', while being completely unrelated to the 'Comedy' answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality

**Overall Notes:**  
Excellent set of clues. The informed clues are precise and descriptive without contamination. The misinformed clues create productive ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect to incorrect choices. The difficulty is appropriate for a game where the goal is to identify the correct answer from a set of choices.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the plot of 'The Hangover' without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects of the story, such as the amnesia, the bachelor party gone wrong, the missing friend, and the chaotic events that follow. They effectively isolate the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues attempt to create ambiguity. The first clue, 'The story unfolds with a man's journey across America, facing challenges and experiencing life to the fullest,' has a *slight* overlap with the 'journey' aspect and could be vaguely associated with 'Forrest Gump.' The second clue, 'The narrative is about a lone hero fighting to save innocent people against a group of dangerous terrorists,' is a more direct misdirection towards 'Die Hard.' The ambiguity is present but not overwhelmingly strong.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are designed to strongly point to the incorrect answers. 'The story centers on a determined individual facing personal obstacles while navigating a journey of self-discovery' plausibly describes 'Forrest Gump.' 'The film showcases a story of courage and resilience as a man fights to survive in a hostile environment' strongly points to 'Die Hard.' They are effectively deceptive and avoid any connection to 'The Hangover.'

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
