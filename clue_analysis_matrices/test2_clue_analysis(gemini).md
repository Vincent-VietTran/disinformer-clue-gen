## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The informed clues are specific to musical composition elements like verses, choruses, and the blend of melody/rhythm/harmony. They avoid direct use of the word 'song'. They describe unique aspects of a song.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues vaguely relate to 'Song' through the concept of storytelling, but are more readily associated with books or movies, creating some productive ambiguity by being related but misleading.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues directly point to 'Building' (structure for specific purposes) and 'Sport' (game played according to rules and competition). They are believable descriptions of the wrong choices and avoid any association with 'Song'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
