## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are specific to songs, mentioning musical elements (verses, choruses, notes, timing, sound) and impact on listeners, without using the word 'song'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The samples relate to the potential choices. One hints at the written word (book) and the other at visual media (movie). They are vague enough to be applicable to different choices, creating productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are clearly pointing to the wrong choices. One emphasizes written words (book) and the other visual moving images (movie). They effectively avoid mentioning the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Both samples are highly specific, focusing on the unique structure and emotional shifts within the song. They avoid mentioning the song's title or band name, focusing instead on musical characteristics. Excellent.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are related to a general narrative of struggle and visual storytelling, which could loosely apply to various songs with dramatic themes or music videos. The ambiguity is effective as it doesn't directly mention music styles or musical elements, and the context could be applied to multiple choices. The focus on 'struggles' and 'battles' is broad enough to be applied to different genres and songs.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues clearly point to the wrong answer choices. The first focuses on a 'hero's journey' and saving the world, a common theme in rock songs (Stairway to Heaven), and the second clue references a magical school and wizardry, which might bring to mind 'Imagine' and Lennon's work, which is very different from Queen.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
