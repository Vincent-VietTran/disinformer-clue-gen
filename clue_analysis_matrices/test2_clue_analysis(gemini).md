**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are very specific to the concept of eliciting laughter and amusement, using descriptive language that directly points to 'Comedy' without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They cover various aspects like dialogue, situations, characters, and the overall goal of entertainment through humor.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues are factually true for 'Comedy' but are general enough to also apply to 'Drama' (complex human emotions, relationships, character development, conflict). They don't strongly apply to 'Action', but the shared trait of 'complex narratives' and 'keeping audiences invested' could vaguely link. The ambiguity is moderate.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue is a perfect description of 'Action' with its focus on chases, explosions, and fights, strongly misdirecting away from 'Comedy'. The second fake clue, focusing on human relationships and societal issues, is a strong descriptor for 'Drama', also effectively misdirecting.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if understood. However, the misinformed clues are general enough that a player might overthink them, and the fake clues are highly specific to the incorrect options, creating a balanced challenge.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'informed' clues are excellent, providing clear, specific, and non-contaminating descriptions of 'Comedy'. The 'fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Action' and 'Drama'. The 'misinformed' clues are moderately ambiguous, being true for both 'Comedy' and 'Drama', which is the desired level of vagueness.

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'The Hangover' without using any forbidden words. They highlight unique plot points like the missing groom, amnesia, the tiger, missing tooth, and baby, as well as the Vegas setting. They effectively differentiate the correct answer from the others.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are far too vague and do not apply to 'The Hangover' at all. They seem to describe a generic journey or self-discovery narrative, which is completely unrelated to the correct answer. They fail the critical requirement of being factually true for the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent fake clues. They strongly point towards 'Forrest Gump' without mentioning it directly, by focusing on a 'journey of self-discovery,' 'encountering various challenges and triumphs,' and 'personal reflection.' They are completely unrelated to 'The Hangover' and effectively misdirect.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer easy to identify if one is familiar with the movie. However, the fake clues are also very convincing for 'Forrest Gump,' which could lead to some deliberation. The misinformed clues are so poor they don't really contribute to difficulty.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer. The fake clues are also very well-crafted to misdirect towards 'Forrest Gump.' The misinformed clues are a significant weakness as they are not factually true for the correct answer and are too vague to be useful for misdirection.
