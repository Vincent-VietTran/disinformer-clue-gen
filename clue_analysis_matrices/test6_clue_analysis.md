The ambiguity is present but could be stronger to truly mislead.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues effectively highlight specific aspects of 'Pride and Prejudice' such as societal dynamics, the evolution of a central relationship from dislike to love, and themes of class and appearance. They avoid direct keywords but use descriptive paraphrases that are strongly indicative of the correct answer. There's a good variety of angles covered.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are quite general and could apply to many romantic narratives. 'Development of a relationship that blossoms over time' and 'emotional growth of main characters' are true for 'Pride and Prejudice' but also plausibly true for 'The Notebook' and 'When Harry Met Sally'. They create some ambiguity but aren't so vague as to be unhelpful.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirections. The first clue strongly points to 'The Notebook' by mentioning 'war' and 'perilous circumstances'. The second clue is very specific to 'When Harry Met Sally' with 'city that never sleeps' and 'exciting events'. They are highly plausible for the incorrect answers and completely irrelevant to 'Pride and Prejudice'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Overall Notes:**  
A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are descriptive and specific without being too obvious. The misinformed clues offer good, albeit general, ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at diverting attention to the incorrect options.
