## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Informed clues generally relate to the correct answer and provide distinct descriptions. However, clue #1 could be more specific, and clue #7 is somewhat generic. Clues #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, and #9 are well-written and effectively point to the answer. Clue #7, although concise, might benefit from more detail.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Lack of diversity in clue lengths; Some clues are too generic

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Misinformed clues #1 and #2 attempt to create ambiguity but could be more effective. Clue #1 is too vague and does not relate closely enough to the answer, while clue #2 seems somewhat plausible but does not strongly mislead towards other options. More convincing misinformed clues would improve the game's challenge.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Fake clues #1 and #2 are effective in misdirecting towards incorrect answer choices. Clue #1 suggests a competitive activity, and clue #2 implies a means of transportation, both of which are plausible but incorrect. These clues successfully fulfill their purpose of creating misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
