---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ❌ FAIL | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 47% (7/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 8/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 14.4 words

**Assessment:** ❌ Critical - Significant length violations require revision

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Most clues are specific and point toward the correct answer. However, some clues may be too generic or lack the level of detail expected for a 20-word limit. For instance, informed_clues #6 contains the phrase 'The medium has evolved over time' which could be more descriptive. Clues should focus on highlighting unique aspects of video games to stand out from book/movie choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- informed_clues #9 contains an overly broad description of the industry

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

Only two clues, misinformed_clues #1 and #2, are provided. While they attempt to create ambiguity by describing a solitary experience, they don't convincingly relate to video games or distinguish from the book/movie choice. A more effective strategy would be to describe a characteristic that could apply to either video games or books, but leans more toward books. For example, 'The experience often involves reading or listening.'

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

Fake clues completely fail to point toward the wrong answer choices. They describe unrelated activities like board games or sports, which doesn't effectively misdirect the player. Clues should clearly point toward the book/movie choice to effectively mislead the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ❌ FAIL |

**Issues Found:** informed_clues #9 contains an overly broad description of the industry

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The difficulty level of the clues is mostly just right. They're not too easy or too hard, but some clues may require a bit more thought to distinguish from book/movie choices. For instance, informed_clues #9 describes the industry's evolution and innovation, which could be more challenging to connect to the answer.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 2.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ⚠️ NEEDS REVISION

**Main Issues:**
- Word count compliance issues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues
- Missing specificity in clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Address length compliance
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The provided clues have some issues with length compliance and specificity. While some clues effectively point toward the correct answer, others struggle to create ambiguity or misdirection. A more effective strategy would be to focus on highlighting unique aspects of video games and using more descriptive language. Additionally, fake clues should clearly point toward the wrong answer choices, and misinformed clues should create more ambiguity by describing characteristics that could apply to either video games or books.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Some clues, such as #2, #5, and #9, are very specific to the game, but others like #1, #3, and #8, could be more specific (e.g., mentioning the Divine Beasts or the Champions).

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 1/5
