1,Inventions,1,Medical,"Medical, Communication, Transportation",5,"The clues are highly specific to the medical field, using precise terminology and concepts directly related to health, disease, and treatment. They avoid any overlap with communication or transportation.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While they are factually true for 'Medical' in a very abstract sense (e.g., medical advancements involve solving problems and creating devices, and the goal is to improve quality of life), they also apply equally, if not more strongly, to 'Communication' and 'Transportation'. They fail the crucial requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers in a way that creates genuine confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of fake clues. The first clue directly and strongly points to 'Communication', while the second clue directly and strongly points to 'Transportation'. Neither clue has any plausible connection to 'Medical', providing strong misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are clear and point directly to the answer. The fake clues are strong misdirectors. The misinformed clues are too weak to cause significant confusion, making the overall difficulty moderate.",The informed and fake clues are well-constructed. The misinformed clues need significant revision to be effective. They are too generic and do not create the required ambiguity by being equally true for all incorrect answers.,14,14,100%,16.9
1,Inventions,2,Vaccine,"Vaccine, Penicillin, X-ray",5,"The clues are highly specific to the concept of vaccines, using precise biological and public health terminology without directly using the answer word or its obvious synonyms. They cover various aspects like immune system training, disease prevention, and antibody stimulation, all pointing directly to 'Vaccine'.",1,These clues are not ambiguously true for all options. The first clue ('treat infections by killing bacteria') is true for Penicillin but not Vaccine or X-ray. The second clue ('see inside the body to diagnose') is true for X-ray but not Vaccine or Penicillin. They fail the critical requirement of being true for ALL choices.,5,These clues effectively misdirect to incorrect answers. The first clue ('treat a wide range of bacterial infections') strongly points to Penicillin. The second clue ('create pictures of internal body structure') strongly points to X-ray. They are completely unrelated to the correct answer 'Vaccine' and are plausible descriptions of the incorrect options.,,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify. The misinformed clues are poorly constructed and do not create the intended ambiguity, further simplifying the game.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the target answer ('Vaccine'). However, the misinformed clues fail to meet the core requirement of being factually true for all answer choices, rendering them ineffective for creating ambiguity. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect to the incorrect options. The overall difficulty is low due to the poor quality of the misinformed clues.",14,14,100%,15.9
2,Inventions,1,Communication,"Medical, Communication, Transportation",4,The clues are descriptive and avoid answer contamination. They cover various aspects of communication effectively.,2,"The misinformed clues are too general. 'Reshaped how humans interact' and 'influenced society' could apply to all three choices: Medical, Communication, and Transportation. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are true for all options without offering any distinguishing characteristics. The intent is to be vague, but these are so vague they don't even offer a hint of ambiguity beyond 'something important'.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first strongly points to Transportation ('global travel', 'linking distant places', 'trade', 'exploration journeys'). The second strongly points to Medical ('breakthroughs in healthcare', 'improving treatment', 'patient outcomes'). They are completely unrelated to Communication.",,4,"The informed clues are strong, and the fake clues are very effective misdirection. The misinformed clues are weak, but the overall combination makes it challenging.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to Communication. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Transportation and Medical. The misinformed clues are too vague and don't create useful ambiguity; they are true for all options without providing any distinguishing characteristics. This makes the game lean towards being difficult due to strong fake clues and clear informed clues, rather than balanced ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.1
2,Inventions,2,Radio,"Radio, Telephone, Internet",5,"The clues are highly specific to radio without using direct keywords. They cover various aspects like wireless transmission, electromagnetic waves, societal impact, and the transmitter/receiver mechanism. No answer contamination is present.",1,"These clues are far too specific to the incorrect answers (Internet and Telephone). They mention 'digital information exchange,' 'global network,' and 'instantaneous voice communication,' which are not true for radio. They fail the critical requirement of being true for all choices.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirections. The first clue ('global network, sharing information immediately') strongly points to the Internet, and the second clue ('instantaneous voice communication') strongly points to the Telephone, effectively diverting attention from Radio.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards the correct answer for someone familiar with the technology. The fake clues provide effective misdirection, making it challenging enough. The misinformed clues are so bad that they don't contribute to difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly descriptive of radio. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting towards the other options. The misinformed clues are critically flawed and do not meet the requirements for ambiguity, serving only to detract from the game's quality.",14,14,100%,15.8
3,Inventions,1,Transportation,"Medical, Communication, Transportation",5,"The clues are highly specific to the concept of transportation, using descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or answer words. They cover various aspects like movement of goods/people, societal impact, technological evolution, and infrastructure. No obvious answer contamination or lack of distinct angles.",2,"These clues are too general. While factually true for 'Transportation', they are also very likely true for 'Communication' and 'Medical' in their broadest senses (e.g., communication improves life quality, medical advancements improve life quality). They don't create productive ambiguity as they are too broadly applicable. The shared truth here is extremely weak.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue ('diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases') is a perfect fit for 'Medical' and completely unrelated to 'Transportation'. The second clue ('exchange of information, ideas, and messages') is a perfect fit for 'Communication' and also unrelated to 'Transportation'. They strongly point away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making the answer identifiable if the player understands the nuances. The fake clues are very deceptive. The misinformed clues are weak and might not confuse players effectively, but the overall balance leans towards a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting. The misinformed clues are too vague and don't create significant ambiguity, which is their primary purpose. The difficulty is moderate due to the strong informed and fake clues.",14,14,100%,15.7
3,Inventions,2,Car,"Car, Airplane, Train",4,"The clues are generally good, providing specific details about the 'Car' without using the word itself. They cover aspects like personal conveyance, suburban development, technological evolution, economic impact, infrastructure, and environmental shifts. Some clues are very strong and specific to cars ('internal combustion engine').",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'improving their lifestyle and freedom greatly' could be argued as more true for a car than a train or airplane in many contexts. The second clue, 'a common and useful tool for moving across distances,' is also too specific to be true for all options in a meaningful way.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue ('traverse vast distances through the skies efficiently') strongly points to 'Airplane', and the second clue ('travels on rails, facilitating the movement of both passengers and cargo across land areas') strongly points to 'Train'. They are completely unrelated to 'Car'.",,4,"The 'Informed' clues are quite specific, making it easier to deduce the answer. The 'Fake' clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The 'Misinformed' clues are weak and do not contribute to productive ambiguity, thus not increasing difficulty as intended. The overall difficulty leans towards moderate-hard due to the strong misdirection of fake clues, but the specific informed clues could lower it.","The 'Informed' clues are well-crafted and specific to the answer 'Car'. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards 'Airplane' and 'Train'. However, the 'Misinformed' clues fail to meet the criteria of being true for all incorrect answers, making them too weak and not contributing to the intended ambiguity or difficulty.",14,14,100%,16.5
4,Inventions,1,Scientific,"Household, Scientific, Navigation",5,"The clues are highly specific to the scientific method and its outcomes without using any forbidden words. They cover experimentation, observation, hypothesis testing, understanding the universe, and collaboration, all strongly pointing to 'Scientific'.",1,These clues are far too specific to 'Household' and 'Navigation' respectively. They do not share any truth with the 'Scientific' answer and therefore do not create productive ambiguity. They are essentially 'Fake' clues for the 'Scientific' answer.,5,These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue ('objects designed to make everyday life easier in the comfort of one's own home') strongly points to 'Household'. The second clue ('process of guiding and controlling the movement of a craft from one place to another') strongly points to 'Navigation'. Neither clue has any plausible connection to 'Scientific'.,,3,"The informed clues are excellent, making the correct answer clear if one focuses on them. However, the presence of genuinely misleading fake clues, and the complete lack of effective misinformed clues (they are essentially fake clues for the correct answer), means the difficulty leans towards moderate. A player would need to carefully distinguish between the informed and fake clues, while the misinformed clues offer no real challenge or ambiguity.","The informed clues are top-notch, precisely defining the scientific domain. The fake clues are also very effective, clearly targeting 'Household' and 'Navigation'. The misinformed clues fail entirely in their purpose; they are too specific to the incorrect answers and do not intersect with the correct answer, effectively acting as additional fake clues for 'Scientific'. This asymmetry in the misinformed clues reduces their quality and the overall ambiguity. The difficulty is moderate due to the strong contrast between informed and fake clues, with the misinformed clues not contributing to productive ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.1
4,Inventions,2,Telescope,"Telescope, Microscope, periscope",5,"The clues are highly specific to the correct answer, using descriptive language that clearly points to a telescope without using any forbidden words or direct synonyms. They cover various aspects of its function and impact.",1,"These clues are not factually true for the correct answer ('Telescope'). The first clue describes a periscope ('view objects that are below the surface'), and the second describes a microscope ('see very tiny objects in great detail'). Therefore, they fail the critical requirement of being 100% factually true for the correct answer.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player. The first clue perfectly describes a periscope, and the second clue perfectly describes a microscope. They are unrelated to the correct answer and strongly point to the incorrect choices.",,4,"The informed clues are excellent and specific, making it easy to identify the correct answer. However, the fake clues are extremely strong misdirections, and the misinformed clues are entirely irrelevant to the correct answer, making the task of distinguishing them challenging. This creates a good level of difficulty.","The informed clues are strong and well-written. The fake clues are excellent misdirections. The misinformed clues are problematic as they are not true for the correct answer, failing a core requirement of the game. This significantly impacts the 'misinformed_quality' score.",14,14,100%,16.8
5,Inventions,1,Household,"Household, Scientific, Navigation",4,"The clues are specific and clearly point to 'Household' items. They avoid answer contamination and offer distinct angles like 'daily living', 'residential settings', and 'domestic life'.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general. While factually true for 'Household', they are also overly true for 'Scientific' and 'Navigation' in a broad sense (e.g., scientific advancements aim to improve human existence, navigation tools make life more efficient). They don't create productive ambiguity as they don't strongly point to the incorrect answers without also pointing to the correct one. They are more like weak informed clues for all categories.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. They perfectly target 'Scientific' and 'Navigation' respectively, using keywords and concepts directly associated with those categories ('scientific concepts', 'human knowledge', 'determine position', 'course', 'distance', 'exploration', 'travel'). They completely avoid any connection to 'Household'.",,3,"The informed and fake clues are well-crafted, making the game playable. The misinformed clues could be improved to create more effective ambiguity, but the overall balance is reasonable.","The informed and fake clues are strong. The misinformed clues need refinement to ensure they are equally applicable to all choices, thereby creating more productive ambiguity. The current misinformed clues are too broad and don't effectively 'misinform' by being true for all options.",14,14,100%,16.5
5,Inventions,2,Light Bulb,"Microwave, Light Bulb, Refrigerator",5,"Clues are highly specific to the light bulb without using forbidden terms. They cover its function, impact on society, and safety benefits effectively. No answer contamination or synonyms found. Diverse angles are covered.",1,"These clues are not factually true for all incorrect answers. For example, a 'microwave' doesn't primarily 'make life more convenient and enhance daily routines' in the same way a refrigerator does for food storage. The goal of shared truth across all options is not met, making them more like 'fake' clues for some options rather than truly ambiguous ones.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards 'Microwave' and 'Refrigerator' respectively, by using defining characteristics of those appliances and completely avoiding any relation to the 'Light Bulb'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer clear if understood. The misinformed clues fail to create ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect. This combination, with strong fake clues, balances the difficulty to a moderate level.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely identify the light bulb. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues fail to meet the criteria of being true for all choices, thus not creating productive ambiguity. This is the main weakness.",14,14,100%,16.1

The goal of shared truth for all options is not met.",5,"The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting to 'Household' and 'Scientific'. 'Creating items to improve daily life' strongly points to 'Household', and 'careful examination of the physical world' strongly points to 'Scientific'. They completely avoid the correct answer 'Navigation'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making it easy to identify the correct answer if the player understands the nuances. The misinformed clues fail to create sufficient ambiguity, leaning towards making the puzzle easier than intended for the misinformed category. The fake clues are effective, but the failure of the misinformed clues balances the difficulty.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and meet their criteria. The misinformed clues need significant revision to ensure they are factually true for all answer choices and create productive ambiguity.

6,Inventions,2,GPS,"GPS, Compass, Map",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using technical terms and concepts directly related to GPS without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover various aspects like satellites, positioning, applications, and accuracy, effectively pointing to GPS.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (GPS, Compass, Map) as they all assist in navigation and understanding location. They avoid specific keywords and focus on general functions, creating plausible ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue 'This is a tool that always points north, allowing for basic directional guidance in different terrains' strongly points to 'Compass'. The second clue 'This is a visual representation of the Earth's surface, used for planning routes and identifying landmarks' strongly points to 'Map'. Neither clue has any relation to GPS.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making GPS clear. However, the misinformed and fake clues are well-crafted to create significant confusion between the other options and distract from the correct answer, balancing the difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing a clear path to the correct answer.

7,Inventions,1,Physics,"Physics, Chemistry, Biology",5,"Clues are highly specific to Physics, using precise terminology and concepts without resorting to synonyms or direct answer words. They cover fundamental aspects like the nature of the universe, matter, energy, space, time, experimentation, laws of motion, gravity, electromagnetism, and mathematical modeling. The clues clearly distinguish Physics from Chemistry and Biology.",1,"These clues are too specific to 'Physics' and do not overlap with Chemistry or Biology. For example, 'systematic study of the structure and behavior of the natural and physical world' could be considered true for Physics, but the addition of 'physical' makes it lean too heavily towards Physics and away from the others. To be truly misinformed, they would need to be applicable to all three fields. As they stand, they are closer to informed or just generally true statements about science without creating ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first clue ('Focuses on the study of life, organisms, and their vital processes, including genetics and evolution.') perfectly describes Biology. The second clue ('It concerns the composition, structure, and behavior of matter, including the interactions of chemical bonds frequently.') is a very strong description of Chemistry. These clues effectively misdirect the player away from Physics and towards the incorrect options.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making Physics identifiable. The misinformed clues are weak and do not create the intended ambiguity. The fake clues are strong and effectively misdirect. The overall difficulty leans towards moderate due to the strong informed and fake clues, but the weak misinformed clues reduce the overall challenge.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their purposes effectively. However, the misinformed clues fail to meet the criteria of being true for all options, thus not creating the desired ambiguity. This significantly impacts the game's balance, making it easier to identify the correct answer based on the informed clues alone.",14,14,100%,16.1
7,Inventions,2,Quantum Theory,"Laws of Motion and Gravity, Quantum Theory, Theory of Relativity",4,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, avoiding direct answer terms. They effectively highlight the unique aspects of quantum theory, such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic nature. There is good diversity in the angles covered.",2,"These clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. While factually true for Quantum Theory, they are also very broadly true for Theory of Relativity. They don't sufficiently overlap with Laws of Motion and Gravity to create the desired confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They are factually true for 'Laws of Motion and Gravity' and completely unrelated to 'Quantum Theory', making them highly effective at pulling players towards an incorrect answer.",,4,"The 'Informed' clues are quite strong, but the 'Misinformed' clues are weak, which might make the puzzle slightly easier than intended for experienced players. However, the 'Fake' clues are very strong misdirection.","The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are well-crafted. The 'Informed' clues are specific and descriptive without being too obvious.

8,Inventions,2,Hammer,"Hammer, Screwdriver, Wrench",5,"The clues are very specific to the hammer's function and design, using descriptive language without directly naming it or its parts. They cover its use in construction, its percussive nature, its shaping capabilities, and its essential role. The clues avoid any ambiguity and clearly point to the hammer.",3,"These clues are factually true for a hammer but also true for a screwdriver and a wrench (all are handheld, used in various industries/tasks). However, they are quite generic and don't offer much in terms of productive ambiguity. A player might lean towards the 'various tasks' and 'home' aspect, which could apply to all tools, but there's no strong pull towards any specific incorrect answer.",5,These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards 'Screwdriver' and 'Wrench'. The descriptions of turning nuts/bolts and tightening/loosening screws are definitive characteristics of those tools and completely absent from the hammer's primary functions.,,3,"The informed clues are excellent, making the correct answer clear if interpreted correctly. The fake clues are very strong misdirections.

9,Inventions,1,Weapon,"Weapon, Armor, Siege Equipment",5,The informed clues are excellent. They directly describe the function and historical significance of weapons without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They are precise and focus on the core concept of inflicting harm and gaining advantage in conflict.,3,"The misinformed clues are somewhat ambiguous. 'Used by individuals or groups for protection or to inflict damage on others' could apply to weapons and armor. 'Tools that have been utilized in numerous conflicts throughout human history, continuously' could also apply to all three.
