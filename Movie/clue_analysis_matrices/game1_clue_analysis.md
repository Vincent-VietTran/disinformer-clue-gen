## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are specific to Sci-Fi without using forbidden words. They highlight technological advancements, future settings, and speculative concepts. Variety of phrasing is good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

Clues are generally true for all options but could be more ambiguous. 'Suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' is a good shared attribute. 'Fantastical elements and imaginative creatures' is a bit more specific to Fantasy, but still plausible for Sci-Fi and Horror in a broad sense.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent. 'Jump scares and intense sound design' strongly points to Horror and is completely unrelated to Sci-Fi. 'Mythical creatures, magic spells, and epic quests' clearly directs towards Fantasy and away from Sci-Fi.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to 'The Matrix' without using forbidden words. They cover different aspects like themes, visuals, narrative, and characters. No answer contamination or synonym use is apparent.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues are factually true for all three options but are too generic. 'This movie has many exciting scenes and is one of the most popular movies of all time' and 'This movie has a lot of special effects and is very entertaining to watch on a big screen' could apply to any major blockbuster. They create ambiguity but not in a particularly productive or challenging way because they are so broad.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to 'The Conjuring' by describing its core plot, and the second clue perfectly describes 'The Lord of the Rings'. They are specific enough to be believable for those choices and completely unrelated to 'The Matrix'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
