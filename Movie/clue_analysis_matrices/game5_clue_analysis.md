## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are specific and accurately describe the 'Horror' genre. They avoid answer contamination by not using the word 'horror' or direct synonyms. The clues cover various aspects like emotional response, themes, common elements, and narrative devices.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too general. While factually true for 'Horror', they are also broadly applicable to 'Thriller' and even 'Sci-Fi' in some contexts, making them only moderately ambiguous. They don't create enough productive confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Sci-Fi' with 'complex plots, time travel, and advanced technology'. The second clue points to 'Thriller' with 'espionage, mystery, and complex plots involving government secrets'. Neither clue relates to 'Horror'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'The Shining', using descriptive language that directly points to its plot, themes, and iconic elements without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They cover isolation, psychological decay, a remote hotel, winter setting, psychic abilities, and disturbing imagery. The score is high due to their precision.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While factually true for 'The Shining', they are also plausibly true for 'Inception' (extraordinary circumstances, dangerous situations, mystery, suspense, plot twists) and 'Alien' (extraordinary circumstances, dangerous situations, suspense). They don't effectively leverage the shared attributes across all three to create meaningful confusion. The score is low because they fail to meet the core requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers while remaining ambiguous.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue perfectly describes 'Inception' with its focus on dream sequences and the subconscious. The second clue strongly points to 'Alien' with its mention of space travelers and hostile extraterrestrial life. They are completely unrelated to 'The Shining', fulfilling the criteria for fake clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong enough to pinpoint the correct answer for those familiar with the film. However, the misinformed clues are too weak to provide significant misdirection, and the fake clues are very strong for the incorrect options. This creates a moderate difficulty where identifying the correct answer is possible but not guaranteed without careful consideration of all clues.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to 'The Shining'. The fake clues are also very effective in misdirecting towards 'Inception' and 'Alien'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part of the set, as they are too general and do not create sufficient ambiguity across all three choices. Improvements to the misinformed clues could enhance the overall game.
