| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the chosen answer, 'Drama,' by focusing on its core elements like emotional depth, character arcs, conflict, and serious themes. They avoid any overlap with 'Romance' or 'Comedy' by not mentioning relationship focus or humor. The language used is descriptive and precise, directly pointing to the intended genre without resorting to overly broad terms.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers (Romance, Comedy) and the correct answer (Drama). For example, 'This genre often features relationship dynamics, conflict, and resolution' is true for Drama and Romance, but not necessarily Comedy, which might focus more on situational humor and less on deep relationship resolution. 'This type of film is designed to resonate with the audience, often highlighting relatable human experiences' is true for all three, but not specific enough to be useful in a misinformed context. They fail to create productive ambiguity because they are too broad to be helpful in distinguishing between the genres in a misinformed way.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective misdirection. They directly and accurately describe 'Comedy' with terms like 'lighthearted elements,' 'witty dialogue,' 'humorous situations,' and 'amusement and laughter.' They are completely unrelated to 'Drama' and do not mention any elements of 'Romance,' making them strongly point away from the correct answer and towards 'Comedy' as a plausible alternative.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

## Overall Assessment

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

1. Minor length adjustments

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct characteristics of 'Drama.' The fake clues are also very strong, effectively misdirecting towards 'Comedy.' The misinformed clues are the weakest part of the set, failing to create useful ambiguity and not adhering to the strict criteria of being true for all options.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately reflecting key plot points, themes, and character arcs of 'The Shawshank Redemption' without using forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively highlight the unique narrative elements.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Titanic, Shawshank, Groundhog Day) as they all involve human relationships, pursuit of happiness, and challenges. However, they are quite general and don't create particularly strong or productive ambiguity for this specific set of choices, leaning towards being too vague.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to 'Titanic' by mentioning a love story complicated by social expectations and family disapproval. The second clue directly describes the central tragedy of 'Titanic'. Both avoid any connection to 'The Shawshank Redemption'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too general to be effective. The fake clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to 'Titanic'. The difficulty is moderate due to the strength of the informed and fake clues balancing out the weakness of the misinformed clues.
