# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 3 | Round 1: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.7 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the 'Action' genre, using terms like 'explosions', 'fist fights', 'high-speed chases', 'stunts', 'physical conflict', 'physical challenges', 'practical effects', 'intense confrontations', and 'tension'. They avoid generic terms and directly describe the core elements of action movies. There's no answer contamination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are a bit too focused on suspense and challenges, which can be present in Thriller and Adventure genres. While true for Action, they don't maximally exploit the ambiguity across all incorrect choices as effectively as they could. For example, 'high stakes and suspense' is very Thriller-leaning. 'Hero or protagonist facing difficult challenges' is true for all three incorrect options, which is good, but the first clue leans too hard away from Adventure and Thriller.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirection. 'Mystery that needs to be solved' strongly points to Thriller or even Adventure. 'Complex plot that explores characters' inner struggles and motivations' is a hallmark of character-driven Thrillers or even dramatic Adventures, effectively steering the player away from the more physically-driven Action genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making Action quite identifiable. The misinformed clues are decent but could be more ambiguous. The fake clues are very effective at misdirection. This combination creates a moderate difficulty, where a player might be pulled by the misinformed and fake clues but can still find the answer through the strong informed clues.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are spot-on and clearly define the 'Action' genre. The fake clues are excellent at diverting attention to 'Thriller' and 'Adventure'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part, being somewhat true for 'Action' but also leaning too heavily into 'Thriller' territory, thus not creating as much shared ambiguity across all incorrect choices as ideal.

**Test Run 3 | Round 2: Movie**

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using strong action verbs and unique descriptive phrases that directly point to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using any of the answer words or close synonyms. They highlight the practical effects, visual storytelling, female character, stunts, vehicular combat, minimal dialogue, desert wasteland setting, iconic vehicle, car chases, survival themes, resource scarcity, and relentless action. These are all defining characteristics of the correct answer and are not shared by the incorrect options.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being factually true for all incorrect answers. 'This film is an exciting, thrilling story that contains a lot of suspense and high stakes' is true for 'Psycho' and 'Indiana Jones' but not necessarily 'Mad Max: Fury Road' in the same way (which is more action-driven than suspense/thrill focused in the traditional sense). 'The story tells of a journey filled with obstacles and characters who face difficult circumstances' is true for all options. However, the first clue is not universally true, making the set ineffective for creating ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('A suspenseful story where a detective solves a complex case involving a mysterious killer and their motives.') strongly points to 'Psycho' by using genre tropes associated with it. The second clue ('The movie is about an archeologist who goes on an adventure to find a priceless artifact.') directly targets 'Indiana Jones' with its defining premise. Both are completely unrelated to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and create strong, plausible misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are excellent and make the correct answer very clear. The fake clues are also very strong for the incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are weak and not universally true, which is a significant flaw in creating ambiguity. However, the strength of the informed and fake clues balances this, making the overall difficulty moderate.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are top-notch, providing very specific details about 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. The fake clues are also excellent, effectively misdirecting to 'Psycho' and 'Indiana Jones'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part of this set, as one of them is not factually true for all options, failing to create the intended ambiguity. Despite this, the strong informed and fake clues make for a reasonably balanced game.
