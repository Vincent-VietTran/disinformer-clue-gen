**Average Word Count:** 16.2 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to comedy, using terms like 'witty dialogue', 'slapstick', 'laughter', 'puns', and 'physical comedy'. They avoid answer contamination and offer distinct angles on the genre's core elements. No synonyms or variations of 'Comedy' are used.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues 'This form of entertainment often features characters involved in complex narratives, keeping audiences invested in the unfolding events and outcomes.' and 'This genre explores complex human emotions and relationships, often focusing on character development and conflict.' are 100% true for Comedy, Action, and Drama. They are vague enough to be applicable to all choices, creating productive ambiguity. The clues are not overly general, but they don't point to any specific incorrect answer over another.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clue 'It typically involves high-speed chases, explosions, and intense fight sequences with heroes and villains battling each other.' strongly and plausibly describes 'Action' while being completely unrelated to 'Comedy'. The clue 'This genre often delves into the complexities of human relationships and societal issues with depth.' plausibly describes 'Drama' and could also be weakly applied to 'Action' but not 'Comedy'. These clues effectively misdirect away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong for Comedy, making it the most likely answer. However, the misinformed clues provide just enough ambiguity to make the player pause and consider if Action or Drama could also fit, especially if they are not deeply familiar with genre definitions. The fake clues are effective misdirectors. This combination offers a moderate challenge.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to Comedy. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to be universally true for all options, creating productive ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Action and Drama. The difficulty is well-balanced.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are precise, descriptive, and avoid any answer words or synonyms. They effectively capture the unique comedic chaos and plot points of 'The Hangover' without being overly broad. The mention of specific elements like the tiger, missing tooth, and baby, alongside the Las Vegas setting and amnesia trope, strongly points to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague. While factually true for 'The Hangover', they are also broadly true for 'Forrest Gump' (journey of self-discovery, overcoming obstacles) and even 'Die Hard' (navigating difficult circumstances). They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so generic they could apply to almost any narrative film with a protagonist facing challenges.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective misdirection. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Forrest Gump' by focusing on self-discovery, personal reflection, and overcoming adversity, while having absolutely no connection to 'The Hangover'. This creates strong pull towards 'Forrest Gump' as a false answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The difficulty is moderate. The 'informed' clues are quite specific to 'The Hangover', making it relatively easy to identify. The 'misinformed' clues are too generic to be truly misleading, and the 'fake' clues are very specific to 'Forrest Gump'. A player would likely lean towards the highly specific 'informed' clues rather than get confused by the weak 'misinformed' or deceptive 'fake' clues.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'informed' clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The 'misinformed' clues are too vague to be effective. The 'fake' clues are very strong misdirection towards 'Forrest Gump'. The game is likely to be on the easier side due to the clarity of the 'informed' clues and the weakness of the 'misinformed' ones.
