---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are specific to the concept of 'Romance' by focusing on love, connection, relationships, intimacy, and desire without using the word 'romance' itself. They effectively highlight the core themes and emotional focus of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague. While factually true for 'Romance', they are also too universally true for 'Drama' and 'Comedy' as well, making them less effective at creating productive ambiguity. The first clue mentions 'conflict' which is more strongly associated with Drama, and the second mentions 'emotional experiences of life and love' which is broad enough to fit all genres, but doesn't specifically point towards Romance over the others.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue is perfectly designed to mislead towards 'Comedy' with 'humor and witty dialogue' and 'comedic situations'. The second fake clue, focusing on overcoming difficult situations through perseverance, strongly points to 'Drama' without any overlap with 'Romance'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong and specific, making 'Romance' identifiable. However, the misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are very effective, which could lead to a slightly higher difficulty if a player over-relies on the misinformed clues or is strongly misled by the fake ones. Overall, a balanced difficulty.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct information about 'Romance'. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Comedy' and 'Drama'. The misinformed clues are the weakest element, being too general and not creating sufficient ambiguity for the intended purpose.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues effectively highlight specific elements of 'Pride and Prejudice' such as the social dynamics, the protagonist's journey, and the evolution of the central relationship. They avoid direct answer words and offer distinct perspectives.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The misinformed clues are too general and could apply to many romance stories. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are not factually true for all the incorrect choices ('The Notebook', 'When Harry Met Sally') in a way that truly intersects with 'Pride and Prejudice' without being overly broad.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player towards 'The Notebook' and 'When Harry Met Sally' respectively, by referencing specific plot points and settings of those movies without any overlap with 'Pride and Prejudice'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
