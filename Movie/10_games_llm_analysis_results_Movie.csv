1,Movie,1,Sci-Fi,"Sci-Fi, Horror, Fantasy",5,"Clues are specific to Sci-Fi without using forbidden words. They highlight technological advancements, future settings, and speculative concepts. Variety of phrasing is good.",3,"Clues are generally true for all options but could be more ambiguous. 'Suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' is a good shared attribute. 'Fantastical elements and imaginative creatures' is a bit more specific to Fantasy, but still plausible for Sci-Fi and Horror in a broad sense.",5,"These clues are excellent. 'Jump scares and intense sound design' strongly points to Horror and is completely unrelated to Sci-Fi. 'Mythical creatures, magic spells, and epic quests' clearly directs towards Fantasy and away from Sci-Fi.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide players toward the correct answer, while the fake clues effectively misdirect. The misinformed clues offer a moderate level of ambiguity, making the game challenging but not impossible.","The informed clues are precise and well-written, avoiding any answer contamination. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting players to the incorrect choices. The misinformed clues provide a decent level of ambiguity, contributing to a balanced difficulty.",15,15,100%,17.5
1,Movie,2,The Matrix,"The Conjuring, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings",5,"Clues are highly specific to 'The Matrix' without using forbidden words. They cover different aspects like themes, visuals, narrative, and characters. No answer contamination or synonym use is apparent.",3,The clues are factually true for all three options but are too generic. 'This movie has many exciting scenes and is one of the most popular movies of all time' and 'This movie has a lot of special effects and is very entertaining to watch on a big screen' could apply to any major blockbuster. They create ambiguity but not in a particularly productive or challenging way because they are so broad.,5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to 'The Conjuring' by describing its core plot, and the second clue perfectly describes 'The Lord of the Rings'. They are specific enough to be believable for those choices and completely unrelated to 'The Matrix'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific enough to guide a player towards the correct answer, while the fake clues provide effective misdirection. The misinformed clues are a bit too vague, which slightly lowers the overall challenge, but the combination still creates a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are too generic and could be improved for more productive ambiguity, but the overall set is good.",15,15,100%,17.1
2,Movie,1,Comedy,"Comedy, Action, Drama",5,"Clues are highly specific to comedy, using terms like 'witty dialogue', 'slapstick', 'laughter', 'puns', and 'physical comedy'. They avoid answer contamination and offer distinct angles on the genre's core elements. No synonyms or variations of 'Comedy' are used.",3,"The clues 'This form of entertainment often features characters involved in complex narratives, keeping audiences invested in the unfolding events and outcomes.' and 'This genre explores complex human emotions and relationships, often focusing on character development and conflict.' are 100% true for Comedy, Action, and Drama. They are vague enough to be applicable to all choices, creating productive ambiguity. The clues are not overly general, but they don't point to any specific incorrect answer over another.",5,"The clue 'It typically involves high-speed chases, explosions, and intense fight sequences with heroes and villains battling each other.' strongly and plausibly describes 'Action' while being completely unrelated to 'Comedy'. The clue 'This genre often delves into the complexities of human relationships and societal issues with depth.' plausibly describes 'Drama' and could also be weakly applied to 'Action' but not 'Comedy'. These clues effectively misdirect away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong for Comedy, making it the most likely answer. However, the misinformed clues provide just enough ambiguity to make the player pause and consider if Action or Drama could also fit, especially if they are not deeply familiar with genre definitions. The fake clues are effective misdirectors. This combination offers a moderate challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to Comedy. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to be universally true for all options, creating productive ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Action and Drama. The difficulty is well-balanced.",14,14,100%,16.2
2,Movie,2,The Hangover,"Die Hard, The Hangover, Forrest Gump",5,"The clues are precise, descriptive, and avoid any answer words or synonyms. They effectively capture the unique comedic chaos and plot points of 'The Hangover' without being overly broad. The mention of specific elements like the tiger, missing tooth, and baby, alongside the Las Vegas setting and amnesia trope, strongly points to the correct answer.",2,"These clues are too vague. While factually true for 'The Hangover', they are also broadly true for 'Forrest Gump' (journey of self-discovery, overcoming obstacles) and even 'Die Hard' (navigating difficult circumstances). They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so generic they could apply to almost any narrative film with a protagonist facing challenges.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Forrest Gump' by focusing on self-discovery, personal reflection, and overcoming adversity, while having absolutely no connection to 'The Hangover'. This creates strong pull towards 'Forrest Gump' as a false answer.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The 'informed' clues are quite specific to 'The Hangover', making it relatively easy to identify. The 'misinformed' clues are too generic to be truly misleading, and the 'fake' clues are very specific to 'Forrest Gump'. A player would likely lean towards the highly specific 'informed' clues rather than get confused by the weak 'misinformed' or deceptive 'fake' clues.",The 'informed' clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The 'misinformed' clues are too vague to be effective. The 'fake' clues are very strong misdirection towards 'Forrest Gump'. The game is likely to be on the easier side due to the clarity of the 'informed' clues and the weakness of the 'misinformed' ones.,14,14,100%,16.7
3,Movie,1,Action,"Action, Thriller, Adventure",5,"The clues are highly specific to the 'Action' genre, using terms like 'explosions', 'fist fights', 'high-speed chases', 'stunts', 'physical conflict', 'physical challenges', 'practical effects', 'intense confrontations', and 'tension'. They avoid generic terms and directly describe the core elements of action movies. There's no answer contamination.",3,"The misinformed clues are a bit too focused on suspense and challenges, which can be present in Thriller and Adventure genres. While true for Action, they don't maximally exploit the ambiguity across all incorrect choices as effectively as they could. For example, 'high stakes and suspense' is very Thriller-leaning. 'Hero or protagonist facing difficult challenges' is true for all three incorrect options, which is good, but the first clue leans too hard away from Adventure and Thriller.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. 'Mystery that needs to be solved' strongly points to Thriller or even Adventure. 'Complex plot that explores characters' inner struggles and motivations' is a hallmark of character-driven Thrillers or even dramatic Adventures, effectively steering the player away from the more physically-driven Action genre.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making Action quite identifiable. The misinformed clues are decent but could be more ambiguous. The fake clues are very effective at misdirection. This combination creates a moderate difficulty, where a player might be pulled by the misinformed and fake clues but can still find the answer through the strong informed clues.","The informed clues are spot-on and clearly define the 'Action' genre. The fake clues are excellent at diverting attention to 'Thriller' and 'Adventure'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part, being somewhat true for 'Action' but also leaning too heavily into 'Thriller' territory, thus not creating as much shared ambiguity across all incorrect choices as ideal.",15,15,100%,16.7
3,Movie,2,Mad Max: Fury Road,"Psycho, Mad Max: Fury Road, Indiana Jones",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using strong action verbs and unique descriptive phrases that directly point to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using any of the answer words or close synonyms. They highlight the practical effects, visual storytelling, female character, stunts, vehicular combat, minimal dialogue, desert wasteland setting, iconic vehicle, car chases, survival themes, resource scarcity, and relentless action. These are all defining characteristics of the correct answer and are not shared by the incorrect options.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being factually true for all incorrect answers. 'This film is an exciting, thrilling story that contains a lot of suspense and high stakes' is true for 'Psycho' and 'Indiana Jones' but not necessarily 'Mad Max: Fury Road' in the same way (which is more action-driven than suspense/thrill focused in the traditional sense). 'The story tells of a journey filled with obstacles and characters who face difficult circumstances' is true for all options. However, the first clue is not universally true, making the set ineffective for creating ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('A suspenseful story where a detective solves a complex case involving a mysterious killer and their motives.') strongly points to 'Psycho' by using genre tropes associated with it. The second clue ('The movie is about an archeologist who goes on an adventure to find a priceless artifact.') directly targets 'Indiana Jones' with its defining premise. Both are completely unrelated to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and create strong, plausible misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are excellent and make the correct answer very clear. The fake clues are also very strong for the incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are weak and not universally true, which is a significant flaw in creating ambiguity. However, the strength of the informed and fake clues balances this, making the overall difficulty moderate.","The informed clues are top-notch, providing very specific details about 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. The fake clues are also excellent, effectively misdirecting to 'Psycho' and 'Indiana Jones'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part of this set, as one of them is not factually true for all options, failing to create the intended ambiguity. Despite this, the strong informed and fake clues make for a reasonably balanced game.",15,15,100%,16.3
4,Movie,1,Drama,"Drama, Romance, Comedy",5,"The clues are highly specific to the chosen answer, 'Drama,' by focusing on its core elements like emotional depth, character arcs, conflict, and serious themes. They avoid any overlap with 'Romance' or 'Comedy' by not mentioning relationship focus or humor. The language used is descriptive and precise, directly pointing to the intended genre without resorting to overly broad terms.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers (Romance, Comedy) and the correct answer (Drama). For example, 'This genre often features relationship dynamics, conflict, and resolution' is true for Drama and Romance, but not necessarily Comedy, which might focus more on situational humor and less on deep relationship resolution. 'This type of film is designed to resonate with the audience, often highlighting relatable human experiences' is true for all three, but not specific enough to be useful in a misinformed context. They fail to create productive ambiguity because they are too broad to be helpful in distinguishing between the genres in a misinformed way.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. They directly and accurately describe 'Comedy' with terms like 'lighthearted elements,' 'witty dialogue,' 'humorous situations,' and 'amusement and laughter.' They are completely unrelated to 'Drama' and do not mention any elements of 'Romance,' making them strongly point away from the correct answer and towards 'Comedy' as a plausible alternative.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify. The fake clues are also very strong in their misdirection towards Comedy. The misinformed clues are too weak and don't contribute meaningfully to the difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct characteristics of 'Drama.' The fake clues are also very strong, effectively misdirecting towards 'Comedy.' The misinformed clues are the weakest part of the set, failing to create useful ambiguity and not adhering to the strict criteria of being true for all options.",15,15,100%,16.1
4,Movie,2,The Shawshank Redemption,"Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, Groundhog Day",5,"Clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately reflecting key plot points, themes, and character arcs of 'The Shawshank Redemption' without using forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively highlight the unique narrative elements.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Titanic, Shawshank, Groundhog Day) as they all involve human relationships, pursuit of happiness, and challenges. However, they are quite general and don't create particularly strong or productive ambiguity for this specific set of choices, leaning towards being too vague.",5,The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to 'Titanic' by mentioning a love story complicated by social expectations and family disapproval. The second clue directly describes the central tragedy of 'Titanic'. Both avoid any connection to 'The Shawshank Redemption'.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable for those familiar with the film. The misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are strong. This balance makes it moderately difficult, as the informed clues are the primary driver of accuracy, while the misinformed clues offer little help and the fake clues are strong diversions.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too general to be effective. The fake clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to 'Titanic'. The difficulty is moderate due to the strength of the informed and fake clues balancing out the weakness of the misinformed clues.,15,15,100%,16.7
5,Movie,1,Horror,"Horror, Thriller, Sci-Fi",4,"The clues are specific and accurately describe the 'Horror' genre. They avoid answer contamination by not using the word 'horror' or direct synonyms. The clues cover various aspects like emotional response, themes, common elements, and narrative devices.",2,"These clues are too general. While factually true for 'Horror', they are also broadly applicable to 'Thriller' and even 'Sci-Fi' in some contexts, making them only moderately ambiguous. They don't create enough productive confusion.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Sci-Fi' with 'complex plots, time travel, and advanced technology'. The second clue points to 'Thriller' with 'espionage, mystery, and complex plots involving government secrets'. Neither clue relates to 'Horror'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and point directly to the answer. The misinformed clues are a bit weak, but the fake clues are very strong, creating a good balance for a moderate difficulty level.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to the correct answer.

5,Movie,2,The Shining,"Inception, The Shining, Alien",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'The Shining', using descriptive language that directly points to its plot, themes, and iconic elements without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They cover isolation, psychological decay, a remote hotel, winter setting, psychic abilities, and disturbing imagery. The score is high due to their precision.",2,"These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While factually true for 'The Shining', they are also plausibly true for 'Inception' (extraordinary circumstances, dangerous situations, mystery, suspense, plot twists) and 'Alien' (extraordinary circumstances, dangerous situations, suspense). They don't effectively leverage the shared attributes across all three to create meaningful confusion. The score is low because they fail to meet the core requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers while remaining ambiguous.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue perfectly describes 'Inception' with its focus on dream sequences and the subconscious. The second clue strongly points to 'Alien' with its mention of space travelers and hostile extraterrestrial life. They are completely unrelated to 'The Shining', fulfilling the criteria for fake clues.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to pinpoint the correct answer for those familiar with the film. However, the misinformed clues are too weak to provide significant misdirection, and the fake clues are very strong for the incorrect options. This creates a moderate difficulty where identifying the correct answer is possible but not guaranteed without careful consideration of all clues.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to 'The Shining'. The fake clues are also very effective in misdirecting towards 'Inception' and 'Alien'. The misinformed clues are the weakest part of the set, as they are too general and do not create sufficient ambiguity across all three choices. Improvements to the misinformed clues could enhance the overall game.",14,14,100%,16.4
6,Movie,1,Romance,"Romance, Drama, Comedy",5,"The clues are specific to the concept of 'Romance' by focusing on love, connection, relationships, intimacy, and desire without using the word 'romance' itself. They effectively highlight the core themes and emotional focus of the genre.",2,"These clues are too vague. While factually true for 'Romance', they are also too universally true for 'Drama' and 'Comedy' as well, making them less effective at creating productive ambiguity. The first clue mentions 'conflict' which is more strongly associated with Drama, and the second mentions 'emotional experiences of life and love' which is broad enough to fit all genres, but doesn't specifically point towards Romance over the others.",5,"The first fake clue is perfectly designed to mislead towards 'Comedy' with 'humor and witty dialogue' and 'comedic situations'. The second fake clue, focusing on overcoming difficult situations through perseverance, strongly points to 'Drama' without any overlap with 'Romance'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making 'Romance' identifiable. However, the misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are very effective, which could lead to a slightly higher difficulty if a player over-relies on the misinformed clues or is strongly misled by the fake ones. Overall, a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct information about 'Romance'. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Comedy' and 'Drama'.

6,Movie,2,Pride and Prejudice,"The Notebook, Pride and Prejudice, When Harry Met Sally",4,"The clues effectively highlight specific elements of 'Pride and Prejudice' such as the social dynamics, the protagonist's journey, and the evolution of the central relationship. They avoid direct answer words and offer distinct perspectives.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general and could apply to many romance stories. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are not factually true for all the incorrect choices ('The Notebook', 'When Harry Met Sally') in a way that truly intersects with 'Pride and Prejudice' without being overly broad.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player towards 'The Notebook' and 'When Harry Met Sally' respectively, by referencing specific plot points and settings of those movies without any overlap with 'Pride and Prejudice'.",,3,"The informed clues provide good direction towards the correct answer, while the fake clues are strong misdirections. The misinformed clues are weak, which slightly lowers the overall difficulty but doesn't make it too easy.",The informed clues are well-crafted and specific.

7,Movie,1,Thriller,"Thriller, Mystery, Action",5,"The clues for 'Thriller' are excellent. They use precise descriptive paraphrases ('suspenseful techniques', 'heightened anxiety', 'sense of unease', 'threat or danger', 'anxiety and excitement', 'dangerous situations', 'twists, turns, and unexpected revelations', 'ticking clock or other time constraints', 'protagonist facing a dangerous situation or adversary', 'dark atmosphere', 'sense of foreboding', 'intense emotional turmoil', 'focus and analyze the whole story', 'misdirection and red herrings') that are all specific to the thriller genre and avoid any mention of the word 'thriller' or its direct synonyms. They effectively highlight the core elements of suspense, tension, and psychological engagement.",3,"The clues for 'Mismformed' are somewhat effective in creating ambiguity. They are factually true for all three genres (Thriller, Mystery, Action) as all three genres aim to keep viewers engaged and excited, and all feature characters overcoming obstacles and facing danger. However, they lean a bit too much towards 'Action' and 'Thriller' without being equally applicable to 'Mystery'. To be more productive, they could be slightly more general. For example, 'This type of narrative involves a sequence of events designed to elicit a strong emotional response from the audience.' This would be true for all three, but the current clues are okay.",5,"The 'Fake' clues are highly effective. 'The story centers on a hero's journey where they battle villains with amazing strength and power.' strongly points to 'Action' by mentioning 'hero's journey', 'villains', 'strength', and 'power'. 'The plot involves car chases, explosions, and fight scenes with high-octane action from beginning to end.' is an even stronger, direct misdirection towards 'Action' with terms like 'car chases', 'explosions', and 'fight scenes'. These clues successfully avoid any overlap with 'Thriller' or 'Mystery'.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The 'Informed' clues are very strong and point clearly to 'Thriller'. The 'Fake' clues are also very effective at misdirecting towards 'Action'.

The first clue strongly describes 'Sherlock Holmes' and the second strongly describes 'James Bond', effectively drawing attention away from the correct answer without being obviously false.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify for someone familiar with the movie. However, the misinformed clues are so vague they don't actively hinder the process, and the fake clues are strong misdirectors.

Some clues are slightly repetitive in theme but offer distinct phrasing.",3,"These clues are too general and could apply to many genres. 'Perilous trials and dangerous journeys' is true for Adventure, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy. 'Courage, perseverance, teamwork, friendship' are universal themes.

They don't sufficiently intersect with the incorrect choices (Family, Comedy) to create meaningful confusion without also strongly pointing to Animation. It's difficult to find a shared attribute that is *also* true for Family and Comedy without being overly general.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirections. 'Human actors telling stories' and 'themes of love, loss, and relationships' strongly point to 'Family' and potentially 'Comedy' without any overlap with 'Animation'.
