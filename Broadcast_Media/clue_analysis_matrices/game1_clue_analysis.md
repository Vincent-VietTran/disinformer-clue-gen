**Test Run 1 | Round 1: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.5 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Sci-Fi, using terms like 'technological advancements,' 'futuristic settings,' 'space travel,' 'robots,' 'aliens,' 'artificial intelligence,' and 'speculative concepts.' They avoid any overlap with Horror or Fantasy and do not use the answer word itself or obvious synonyms.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues are somewhat ambiguous but could be slightly more productive. 'Features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' is true for Sci-Fi but also strongly for Horror. 'Involves fantastical elements and imaginative creatures' is true for Sci-Fi (aliens, AI can be 'fantastical' in a broad sense) and also Fantasy, but less so for Horror unless it's supernatural horror. The goal is for these to be *equally* true for all options, which is a very high bar. These are decent attempts at shared truth.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Horror ('jump scares,' 'dread and fear') and Fantasy ('mythical creatures,' 'magic spells,' 'enchanted landscapes'). They contain no elements that would suggest Sci-Fi, making them excellent misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one focuses on them. However, the misinformed clues, while not perfectly ambiguous, do add a layer of potential confusion, and the fake clues are strong misdirectors. This combination creates a moderate difficulty level.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to Sci-Fi without using forbidden terms. The fake clues are highly effective misdirectors for Horror and Fantasy. The misinformed clues are a good attempt at creating ambiguity, though achieving perfect shared truth across all options is challenging.
