## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are specific to the core themes of romance, such as 'human connection', 'emotional bond', 'pursuit of love', 'passionate relationships', 'courtship', 'affection', 'finding and maintaining love', and 'intimate relationships'. They effectively describe romance without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They cover different facets of the genre, providing distinct angles.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues 'This genre commonly deals with stories that feature characters and their interactions, often including conflict.' and 'It involves narratives featuring people and their interactions, frequently addressing emotional experiences of life and love.' are indeed true for Romance, Drama, and Comedy. However, the second clue uses 'love' which might slightly lean towards Romance, potentially reducing its perfect ambiguity for all three. The ambiguity is productive but could be stronger by removing 'love'.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue ('This type of film is characterized by its humor and witty dialogue, often featuring comedic situations and characters.') strongly points to Comedy. The second fake clue ('The characters in this genre frequently encounter difficult situations, which they must overcome through perseverance.') strongly points to Drama. Both are effective misdirections and completely unrelated to Romance.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The informed clues are excellent. They use descriptive language that directly points to 'Pride and Prejudice' without using forbidden words or synonyms. Clues like 'intricate social dynamics of the British upper class during the 19th century' and 'initial dislike that evolves into a deep connection through misunderstanding' are highly specific and accurate for the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are sufficiently vague. 'The story revolves around the development of a relationship between two characters that blossoms over time' could apply to all three choices. 'The central narrative focuses on the emotional growth of the main characters and their journey through life' is also general enough to fit all options, creating productive ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. 'The story revolves around a couple's journey to find love in the midst of a war, facing many perilous circumstances' strongly points to 'The Notebook' and avoids 'Pride and Prejudice'. 'A story of two people falling in love while living in a city that never sleeps, with many exciting events' is a clear misdirection towards 'When Harry Met Sally'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
