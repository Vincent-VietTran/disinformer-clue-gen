# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 10 | Round 1: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are very specific to 'Documentary' and avoid any overlap with the other choices. They highlight the non-fictional, educational, and evidence-based nature of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too specific and would point directly to 'Biography' or potentially 'Educational' rather than being ambiguous for all incorrect choices. They fail the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Biography' by focusing on fictional characters and dramatic storylines, which are antithetical to 'Documentary'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are strong, and the 'Fake' clues are effective misdirection. The 'Misinformed' clues are weak and would need significant revision to create productive ambiguity. This makes the overall difficulty moderate.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are well-constructed. The 'Misinformed' clues need to be rewritten to be more ambiguous and applicable to all incorrect choices. Currently, they are too specific and would not serve their purpose.

# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 10 | Round 2: Movie**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Fred Rogers and 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?', effectively describing his work, philosophy, and impact without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They cover different facets of his legacy, from community and empathy to children's education and emotional development. The language is descriptive and evocative.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague and could potentially apply to any biographical film about a public figure. While factually true for 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?', they are also true for 'Steve Jobs' (a public figure whose impact on the world is undeniable) and potentially even 'Cosmos' (though less directly biographical, it's about a public figure's exploration and impact). The ambiguity is present but not very productive as it doesn't strongly suggest any incorrect answer over another, nor does it offer a strong pull towards the correct answer beyond the most basic biographical aspect.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. The first clue ('tech innovator whose inventions revolutionized the world') perfectly targets 'Steve Jobs' without any overlap with 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?'. The second clue ('scientist who explored the mysteries of the universe') strongly points to 'Cosmos' (and Carl Sagan), again with no overlap with the correct answer. They are plausible and specific to the incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear to someone familiar with Fred Rogers. The misinformed clues are too generic to be truly misleading, and the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The difficulty is moderate because the informed clues are excellent, but the misinformed clues don't create enough confusion, and the fake clues are very strong.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Generic/vague clues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are outstanding. The misinformed clues are too generic and don't create productive ambiguity. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The overall game balance leans towards making the correct answer discoverable through informed clues, while the fake clues provide strong decoys.
