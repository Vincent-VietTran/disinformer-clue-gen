## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, directly referencing key characters, plot points, and themes unique to 'Toy Story' without using any forbidden words. They effectively isolate the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and could apply to almost any animated movie. They do not meet the critical requirement of being true for all incorrect answers and the correct answer. For example, 'lighthearted story for family viewing' is true for Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Shrek. However, 'strong sense of friendship and the importance of helping others' is also true for all three. The clues are not productively ambiguous because they are too broad to be useful in a disinformer context.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'Fake' clues are highly effective. The first clue precisely describes 'Finding Nemo' with its underwater setting and clownfish protagonist. The second clue accurately describes 'Shrek' with its green ogre and princess narrative. Both are designed to strongly and plausibly point to incorrect answers while being completely unrelated to 'Toy Story'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. The 'Fake' clues are also well-crafted to point away from the correct answer. The 'Misinformed' clues are too weak to add significant ambiguity, leaning towards making the puzzle easier than intended.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are excellent and well-aligned with their intended functions. The 'Misinformed' clues are too general and fail to create productive ambiguity, making them the weakest part of this set. The difficulty is slightly lower than ideal due to the weakness of the 'Misinformed' clues.
