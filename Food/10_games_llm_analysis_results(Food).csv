1,Food,1,Italian,"Italian, Mediterranean, European",4,"The clues are quite specific and accurately describe Italian cuisine without being overly obvious. They touch upon key characteristics like fresh ingredients, pasta, cheese, and social dining. There is a good variety of descriptive angles.",2,"The misinformed clues are too vague and don't create productive ambiguity. While factually true for Italian cuisine, they are also true for 'Mediterranean' and 'European' in a very general sense, but lack the specific overlap needed to be truly confusing. They are almost too generic to be useful.",5,These clues are effective in misdirecting. The first clue about spices and complex flavors strongly points towards 'Mediterranean' or potentially other global cuisines. The second clue about healthy ingredients and salads also leans towards 'Mediterranean' and away from the common perception of Italian food (though it can be healthy). They successfully avoid Italian cuisine.,,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards the correct answer for someone familiar with the cuisine, but the fake clues introduce enough misdirection (especially towards Mediterranean) to make it challenging. The misinformed clues are weak and don't contribute much to the difficulty.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific. The fake clues are excellent for misdirection, strongly suggesting 'Mediterranean'. The misinformed clues are too vague to be effective in creating ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.1
1,Food,2,Pizza Margherita,"Paella, Pizza Margherita, Croissant",4,"The clues are generally good at describing Pizza Margherita without using explicit keywords. They highlight the simplicity, the colors, the ingredients (sauce, cheese, herb), and its classic status. There's a slight overlap in mentioning 'classic' and 'loved by many' but overall they point well to the specific dish. The clue 'recognized by its use of specific colors, representing a flag' is a very strong hint for Margherita.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general. 'Popular food item enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds' and 'frequently prepared and consumed by people of many different cultures' are true for all three dishes (Paella, Pizza Margherita, Croissant). They don't create productive ambiguity because they offer no distinguishing features. A better misinformed clue would share a characteristic that is true for Paella and Croissant but not Pizza Margherita, or vice-versa, while still being true for at least one other option.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. 'Layers of flaky pastry' strongly points to Croissant, and 'savory delight, showcasing the flavors of saffron, rice, and seafood' perfectly describes Paella. They are distinct, believable, and effectively misdirect away from Pizza Margherita.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide players towards the correct answer, but the misinformed clues are too vague to cause significant confusion. The fake clues are very effective at misdirection. This combination makes the game moderately challenging.","Strong informed and fake clues. Misinformed clues need improvement for better ambiguity. The game is well-balanced in terms of clue types, with the fake clues being particularly effective.",14,14,100%,16.5
2,Food,1,Mexican,"Mexican, Latin American, British",4,"The clues are specific and descriptive, effectively pointing to the correct answer without using answer-specific terminology. They cover various aspects like ingredients, preparation, and cultural significance.",3,"The misinformed clues are somewhat ambiguous. While true for many cuisines, they are not so broad as to be completely uninformative. They could be slightly more intertwined with the incorrect options to maximize ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. They strongly and plausibly describe the 'British' and 'Latin American' options respectively, using distinct culinary tropes (pies/stews/potatoes for British, rice/beans/plantains for Latin American) that are clearly not associated with the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues could be slightly more ambiguous. The fake clues are very effective, creating good misdirection. This balance leads to a moderate difficulty.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted. The misinformed clues could be improved by increasing their shared applicability to all options. The overall difficulty is appropriate for the game's intent.,14,14,100%,16.1
2,Food,2,Tacos,"Empanadas, Tacos, Jerk Chicken",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid answer contamination. They effectively narrow down the options to 'Tacos' by highlighting key characteristics like the shell, handheld nature, street food popularity, and customization. One clue ('The item's name derives from a word meaning 'plug' or 'wad' which describes how it is assembled.') is particularly strong and specific to tacos.",2,"These clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. 'These foods are often served in a portable form, making them suitable for on-the-go consumption' is true for all three options. 'This food item can be customized with various fillings and toppings, catering to different tastes' is also true for Empanadas and Jerk Chicken (in terms of sides and sauces). The clues are factually correct for all options but lack the nuance to create confusion.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue ('These dishes are often filled with a savory mixture of meat, vegetables, and spices, baked in a pastry.') strongly points to 'Empanadas' without mentioning the word. The second clue ('This food is prepared with marinated chicken, cooked over an open flame, and served with rice and peas.') clearly describes 'Jerk Chicken'. Both fake clues avoid any overlap with 'Tacos'.",,4,"The strong 'informed' clues and highly effective 'fake' clues make this a challenging round. Players would need to carefully consider the nuances of the 'informed' clues to differentiate 'Tacos' from potentially similar dishes, while the 'fake' clues actively pull them towards incorrect answers.","A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. The fake clues are excellent, providing strong misdirection to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues could be improved to create more ambiguity.",14,14,100%,17.1
3,Food,1,Chinese,"Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese",5,"The clues are highly specific to Chinese cuisine, using descriptive language that avoids direct keywords. They highlight unique cooking methods, common ingredients, serving styles, regional variations, and the cultural significance, effectively pointing to the correct answer without being overly obvious.",3,"The misinformed clues are a bit borderline. 'Use of chopsticks' is strongly associated with East Asian cuisines, including Chinese, Japanese, and to some extent Vietnamese. 'Tea ceremonies' are most strongly linked to Japan and China, but can be found in other cultures. 'Widely enjoy and love' is extremely broad. They offer some ambiguity but could potentially be narrowed down more effectively.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Japanese cuisine (seafood, vinegared rice, simplicity), and the second clue strongly points to Vietnamese cuisine (rice noodles, herbs, sweet/sour/spicy balance). They effectively distract from the correct answer by describing plausible incorrect options in detail.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable if one is knowledgeable. However, the misinformed and fake clues are well-crafted to create confusion, especially the fake clues which strongly point to Japanese and Vietnamese food, thus balancing the difficulty.",A well-balanced set of clues. The informed clues are specific and descriptive. The fake clues are particularly effective at misdirecting towards Japanese and Vietnamese cuisine. The misinformed clues could be slightly more ambiguous but still serve their purpose.,14,14,100%,16.4
3,Food,2,Dim Sum,"Dumplings, Dim Sum, Peking Duck",5,"The informed clues are excellent. They use precise descriptive paraphrases that directly point to 'Dim Sum' without using any of the answer words or synonyms. Clues like 'traditionally served in small portions, perfect for sharing' and 'culinary practice where chefs skillfully wrap fillings in dough and then steam the food' are highly specific to Dim Sum.",3,"The misinformed clues are adequately ambiguous. 'The food is typically served hot, and it offers a variety of tastes and textures for all to enjoy' is true for all options. 'These dishes are often eaten using chopsticks, and they are usually shared among family and friends' is also true for all options. They don't strongly lean towards any incorrect answer but also don't eliminate them effectively.",4,"The fake clues are effective at misdirection. 'The food often features thinly sliced meat, vegetables, and rice seasoned with teriyaki sauce and soy' strongly points to Peking Duck. 'These dishes are known for their fresh ingredients, aromatic herbs, and the use of rice paper to eat' plausibly describes dumplings, though less strongly than the first fake clue points to Peking Duck.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The informed clues are very strong, making it easier to identify the correct answer if you understand them well. However, the misinformed clues provide just enough ambiguity to make a player second-guess. The fake clues are strong misdirectors, increasing the challenge.","This is a well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are highly specific and adhere to the criteria. The misinformed clues provide appropriate ambiguity, and the fake clues offer effective misdirection towards incorrect options, particularly Peking Duck. The difficulty is balanced.",14,14,100%,17.0
4,Food,1,Japanese,"Japanese, Korean, Indian",4,"The clues are descriptive and point well to the specific characteristics of Japanese cuisine, such as emphasis on fresh ingredients, seasonality, precise preparation, and common ingredients like rice, noodles, and seafood. They avoid obvious keywords but are specific enough to differentiate from general Asian cuisines.",4,"These clues are good examples of productive ambiguity. 'Popular and well-loved' and 'associated with rice, vegetables, and savory flavor combinations' are true for Japanese, Korean, and Indian cuisines to varying degrees, creating confusion. They are general enough to apply broadly.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirections. 'Aromatic spices, creamy sauces' and 'fiery spices, rich gravies' strongly evoke Indian cuisine, making them a plausible but incorrect choice for someone trying to identify Japanese food.",,3,"The combination of well-crafted informed clues, ambiguously worded misinformed clues, and strongly misleading fake clues creates a balanced difficulty. The fake clues are the main challenge, requiring careful differentiation.","The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer without being overly obvious. The misinformed clues are general and true for multiple options, fostering ambiguity. The fake clues are excellent misdirections towards Indian cuisine, making the game challenging and engaging.",14,14,100%,16.6
4,Food,2,Sushi,"Sushi, Tempura, Ramen",4,"The clues are good and descriptive, avoiding direct answer words. They effectively point to Sushi by highlighting its key characteristics like vinegared rice, seafood, visual presentation, and accompaniments.",2,"These clues are too vague. While factually true for Sushi, they are also true for many other dishes that might involve grains or seafood, making them not productively ambiguous within this specific choice set. They don't create enough confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first perfectly describes Ramen, and the second accurately describes Tempura, making them highly effective at pulling players away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are too weak. The fake clues are very strong, which balances out the weak misinformed ones. This makes the difficulty moderate, leaning towards slightly easier due to the poor misinformed clues.","The informed clues are strong and specific to Sushi. The fake clues are very effective in misdirecting towards Ramen and Tempura. However, the misinformed clues are too generic and do not create sufficient ambiguity within the given choices, making them less effective than they could be.",14,14,100%,17.2
5,Food,1,Indian,"Indian, African, Middle Eastern",4,"The clues are generally good and point towards Indian cuisine, but some could be slightly more precise. For example, 'diverse cooking techniques' is broad. The mention of the tandoor oven is a strong clue, but not exclusive. Overall, they are specific enough without being overly obvious.",3,"These clues are factually true for Indian cuisine but also for African and Middle Eastern cuisines, creating ambiguity. 'Commonly consumed around the world' and 'wide array of options' are very general. They don't offer enough specific shared attributes to be truly misleading but also don't strongly eliminate options.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly evokes Middle Eastern cuisine with 'flatbreads and grilled meats' and 'nomadic lifestyle'. The second clue clearly points to Mediterranean influences, which aligns with Middle Eastern but not African or Indian. They effectively pull attention away from the correct answer.",,4,"The informed clues are strong but require some knowledge of culinary practices. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players, and the misinformed clues are vague enough to cause hesitation. This combination creates a challenging game.",The informed clues are well-crafted and specific enough to identify the correct answer with some deduction. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards Middle Eastern cuisine. The misinformed clues are appropriately vague. The overall difficulty is high due to the effective fake clues.,14,14,100%,16.8
5,Food,2,Butter Chicken,"Chicken parmesan, Butter Chicken, Jerk Chicken",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language to pinpoint Butter Chicken without using any of the answer words or obvious synonyms. They cover origin, ingredients, texture, preparation, and cultural significance effectively.",2,"These clues are too vague and could easily be interpreted as describing Butter Chicken itself, rather than being truly ambiguous across all options. 'Poultry as its main ingredient' and 'comfort food' are too close to the correct answer's attributes without being equally applicable to the other choices in a way that creates productive ambiguity. They don't effectively create confusion across all options.",5,"These clues are excellent. 'Breaded chicken, topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese' perfectly describes Chicken Parmesan. 'Spicy marinade and smoky flavor, often cooked over an open fire' strongly points to Jerk Chicken. They are highly plausible for the incorrect options and completely avoid the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable if one is familiar with the dish. However, the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player to the incorrect options, balancing the difficulty. The misinformed clues are a weak point and could be improved for better ambiguity.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues need improvement to ensure they are truly ambiguous across all choices and not too close to the correct answer.,14,14,100%,16.7
6,Food,1,Main Course,"Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert",5,"The clues are very specific to the concept of a main course, using terms like 'centerpiece', 'protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables', 'significant portion', and 'primary dish'. They effectively describe the role and composition of a main course without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. The variety of angles (role in meal, composition, presentation) is good.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options (Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert) as they all involve eating, are part of a meal, and are consumed at a specific point. However, they are extremely vague and don't offer much productive ambiguity. They rely heavily on the 'true for all' rule but lack any descriptive power to create interesting confusion.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. The first clue perfectly describes an 'Appetizer' ('beginning of a meal', 'stimulate the appetite'). The second clue perfectly describes a 'Dessert' ('sweet dish', 'end of a meal', 'pleasant finish'). They strongly point away from the correct answer 'Main Course' by clearly defining the incorrect options.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, while the fake clues are very targeted misdirection. The misinformed clues are weak but fulfill the technical requirement of being true for all. This combination provides a moderate challenge where players need to discern the specific from the general and avoid the tempting fake clues.","The informed clues are excellent, hitting all the requirements. The fake clues are also very well-crafted for misdirection. The misinformed clues are technically correct but lack the desired ambiguity and descriptive power to be truly productive. They are too generic. Overall, a strong set with a minor weakness in the misinformed category.",14,14,100%,17.6
6,Food,2,Beef Wellington,"Beef Wellington, Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara",5,"The clues are highly specific to Beef Wellington without using any keywords. They effectively describe the pastry, the duxelles, the occasion, the complexity, and the textural contrasts. The score is high because they are precise and avoid answer contamination.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Beef Wellington, Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara) as they are all classic dishes, often served hot, and typically part of a main meal. However, they are quite generic and don't create much productive ambiguity. They lean towards being too vague rather than creating confusion based on shared attributes.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue perfectly describes Lasagna, and the second perfectly describes Spaghetti Carbonara, using defining characteristics of those dishes without any overlap with Beef Wellington. They are highly effective at steering players away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable if the player knows it. The fake clues are also quite strong for the incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are weak, which lowers the overall ambiguity. The difficulty is moderate as the informed clues are precise.","The informed and fake clues are very well-crafted and meet their respective criteria effectively. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but lack the productive ambiguity desired, making them too general. The difficulty is balanced by the strength of the informed and fake clues.",14,14,100%,17.7
7,Food,1,American,"American, British, Tex-Mex",4,"The clues effectively describe American cuisine without using direct keywords. They highlight diversity, bold flavors, comfort food, global influence, and common ingredients. Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other, but overall good coverage.",2,"The misinformed clues are too generic. 'Sustain life and provide energy' and 'use of ingredients and cooking methods' are true for virtually any cuisine, making them almost useless for creating ambiguity between the choices. They don't offer enough shared specificity to be productively ambiguous.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue strongly points to British cuisine ('bangers and mash', 'Sunday roasts'), and the second clue strongly points to Tex-Mex ('spices, chilies, bold tastes'). They effectively distract from the correct 'American' answer.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to point towards American cuisine, but the fake clues are very strong misdirectors towards British and Tex-Mex respectively. The misinformed clues are too vague to be helpful. The balance of strong fake clues and somewhat useful informed clues creates a moderate difficulty.",The informed clues provide good descriptive detail for American cuisine. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards British and Tex-Mex. The misinformed clues are too vague to be useful for creating productive ambiguity.,14,14,100%,16.3
7,Food,2,Cheeseburger,"Fried Chicken, Cheeseburger, BBQ Ribs",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language to define the components and characteristics of a cheeseburger without explicitly naming it or its synonyms. They effectively rule out the other options by focusing on the layered assembly, the dairy product, and the specific type of bread.",1,"These clues are too general and do not meet the criteria of being true for all options. For example, 'This food item often combines various ingredients to create a flavorful and satisfying culinary experience' is true for all, but 'This dish is a popular meal choice across many cultures, enjoyed by people from all walks of life' is less true for BBQ Ribs than for the others. The goal is to have clues that are *equally* true for all incorrect options and the correct answer. These are not productive ambiguities.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Fried Chicken' with the mention of sauces and tangy taste. The second clue also clearly targets 'Fried Chicken' with 'crispy coating' and 'tender, juicy meat'. They effectively steer the player away from the correct answer.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong, but the misinformed clues are too weak and not truly ambiguous. The fake clues are very strong misdirectors. This combination makes it a bit challenging due to the strong fakes, but the weak misinformed clues don't add productive ambiguity.","The informed clues are excellent, providing precise details without revealing the answer. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting towards 'Fried Chicken'. However, the misinformed clues fail to meet the core requirement of being factually true for ALL options (correct and incorrect), making them ineffective for creating ambiguity. This imbalance affects the overall quality of the game design.",14,14,100%,16.9
8,Food,1,Thai,"Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to Thai cuisine without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like flavor profiles, ingredients, and dining culture.",3,"The clues are factually true for all options. 'This cuisine is often prepared using a variety of cooking techniques to create diverse dishes' is true for Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. 'This cuisine is enjoyed by people from many different backgrounds and cultures around the world' is also universally true. They offer some ambiguity but might not be the most productive in confusing the player.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to Vietnamese cuisine (fish sauce, fermented), and the second clue is a very strong indicator of Japanese cuisine (raw fish, vinegared rice). They completely avoid any connection to Thai cuisine.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are somewhat generic, and the fake clues are very direct misdirections to the incorrect options. This creates a moderate level of difficulty where careful consideration of the informed clues is needed, and the fake clues are powerful distractors.",The informed clues are excellent. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but could be more ambiguous. The fake clues are very well-crafted to misdirect. The difficulty is appropriate.,15,15,100%,16.3
8,Food,2,Pad Thai,"Pad Thai, Tom Yum, Green Curry",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using unique characteristics of Pad Thai without directly naming ingredients or common phrases. They effectively narrow down the possibilities to the correct answer.",2,"These clues are too general. While factually true for Pad Thai, they are also true for Tom Yum and Green Curry (all are well-known, loved, savory, served in restaurants/homes). They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so broad they could apply to almost any popular dish. They fail the '100% factually true for ALL incorrect answers' rule in terms of creating useful ambiguity because they are universally true for all choices.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Green Curry (coconut milk broth, vegetables, meat/seafood). The second clue points to Tom Yum (complex blend of spices/herbs, often includes meat) or Green Curry. They are highly plausible for the incorrect answers and completely unrelated to Pad Thai.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable. The fake clues are effective misdirection, and the misinformed clues are too weak to be significantly confusing. This creates a balanced difficulty.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues are too vague to be effective in creating ambiguity.,15,15,100%,16.6
9,Food,1,Middle Eastern,"Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Indian",4,"The clues are specific enough to point towards the Middle Eastern cuisine without explicitly naming it or its ingredients. They use descriptive language effectively. 'Dishes from this culinary tradition frequently include items such as mashed chickpeas, grilled meats, and filled vegetables.' and 'The food culture in this area frequently uses olive oil, lemon juice, and herbs to enhance food's taste.' are particularly strong.",4,"The misinformed clues are well-crafted. They are factually true for all three categories (Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Indian) and are general enough to cause confusion. 'This cuisine may involve the use of herbs, spices, and other ingredients to enhance the meal's flavors.' is a good example of shared truth. 'This type of food usually features a variety of dishes, including vegetarian and meat-based options for people.' is also effectively ambiguous.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. 'This cuisine often features rice as a staple, with spices like turmeric and saffron for vibrant color.' strongly points to Indian cuisine. 'This food culture has a strong emphasis on seafood, using ingredients like tomatoes and olive oil.' plausibly points to Mediterranean. Both are effective misdirections away from Middle Eastern.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide an informed player, while the misinformed clues provide sufficient ambiguity. The fake clues offer strong misdirection to specific incorrect options, making the game challenging but fair.","A well-balanced set of clues. The informed clues are precise, the misinformed clues are ambiguous and factually sound across all options, and the fake clues provide effective misdirection. The difficulty is appropriate for a game where players need to deduce the correct answer from nuanced clues.",14,14,100%,16.5
9,Food,2,Falafel,"Gyro, Falafel, Paella",5,"Clues are highly specific to falafel without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They cover preparation, ingredients, serving style, and dietary aspects effectively.",2,"The clues are too vague and don't create productive ambiguity. 'Delicious food item served in sandwiches and wraps' and 'meal includes vegetables and sauces' could apply to Gyro and Paella too, but not in a way that truly confuses. The shared truth is very shallow.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first directly points to Paella ('saffron-infused rice', 'seafood'). The second points strongly to Gyro ('tomatoes, onions, garlic' are common in gyro preparations, though also in falafel, the rice clue is the stronger misdirection).",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are weak, making it lean towards easier. However, the fake clues do offer a good challenge by strongly pointing to incorrect answers.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The misinformed clues are too vague and don't effectively create ambiguity. The fake clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to Gyro and Paella.,14,14,100%,17.4
10,Food,1,Sweet,"Savory, Sweet, Spicy",4,"The clues are specific and descriptive, directly pointing to the correct answer without using any of the answer words or synonyms. They offer distinct angles on the concept of 'sweet'.",2,"The misinformed clues are too vague. While factually true for all options (Savory, Sweet, Spicy), they are so general that they offer very little productive ambiguity. They could almost be considered too ambiguous to be useful for creating confusion.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue strongly points to 'Spicy' by mentioning chili peppers and heat, and the second clue strongly points to 'Savory' by mentioning saltiness and enhancing flavors. They are well-crafted to misdirect.",,4,"The strong fake clues and the adequate informed clues create a good level of difficulty. The misinformed clues could be improved to add more confusion, but the overall balance is good.","The informed and fake clues are well-executed.

10,Food,2,Tiramisu,"Croissant, Tiramisu, Ice Cream",5,"Clues are highly specific to Tiramisu, using descriptive language without using the word itself or direct synonyms. They cover key ingredients, origin, name meaning, and textural/flavor profiles.",1,"These clues are far too general and do not create productive ambiguity. 'Served cold' and 'sweet treat' could apply to many desserts, but they don't create a plausible overlap that would confuse someone trying to distinguish between Tiramisu, Croissant, and Ice Cream. They are too weak to be useful misdirection.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Croissant ('baked good', 'buttery, flaky crust', 'sweet or savory filling'). The second clue strongly points to Ice Cream ('frozen treat', 'creamy texture', 'variety of flavors', 'cones'). Both are highly plausible descriptions of the incorrect options and completely avoid any connection to Tiramisu.",,4,"The strong 'fake' clues pointing to the incorrect answers, combined with highly specific 'informed' clues for the correct answer, create a challenging but solvable puzzle. The misinformed clues are too weak to significantly impact difficulty, but the strength of the informed and fake clues makes it non-trivial.","The 'informed' clues are excellent, providing strong, descriptive hints for Tiramisu without giving it away too easily. The 'fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards Croissant and Ice Cream.
