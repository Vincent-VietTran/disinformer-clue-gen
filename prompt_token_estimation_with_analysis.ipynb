    "1. Modify the `selected_topic` line to select the specific topic batch you want to process\n",
    "2. Run all cells in order\n",
    "3. Files will be saved in `EN/{topic_name}/` folder, where the topic folder is named after the game topic (spaces and slashes converted to underscores)\n",
    "4. All analysis matrices will be saved in a `clue_analysis_matrices` subfolder within each topic folder\n",
    "5. The `EN/` prefix signifies this is the origin clue contents is in english\n",
    "6. If a topic already exists in EN/, it will be replaced with the newly generated one\n",

    "You are the game master of a game called \"Disinformer\", which is similar to the \"message relay\" game. Below is the description of how the game works:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this cooperative game, players use communication and teamwork to uncover the original prompt over multiple rounds of clues. Along the way, they must contend with a disruptive \"Disinformer,\" varying player interpretations, and time limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a minimum of 3 players and maximum of 10 players:\n",
    "- Regular players (a.k.a. the netizens): The job is to solve clues and discover the original prompt\n",
    "- at most 2 misinformed players: Has the same job as the regular players. However, this player is unknowingly being given vague/ambiguous clues.\n",
    "- at most 2 disinformer players: The job is to solve clues and discover prompt to persuade other players from clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be 2 rounds in each game.\n",
    "- In the first round, the players will be given clues to guess a general category/term (e.g. \"movie\", \"song\", \"novel\", etc)\n",
    "- In the second round, the players will be given clues to guess a more specific thing (e.g. \"The Dark Knight (2008)\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Novel)\", \"Space Oddity - David Bowie (1969)\", etc) which is related to the general category in the previous round.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each round, there will be 3 type of clues for each player:\n",
    "- Informed: Clear but challenging clues that directly relate to the correct answer. These should guide players toward the right answer through precise hints.\n",
    "  - **Disallowed:**using the exact answer word, any morphological variations (e.g., plural/singular forms), or direct synonyms (words that mean the same thing).  \n",
    "  - **Allowed:** using descriptive paraphrases or indirect expressions that convey the concept creatively without naming it or its synonyms.  \n",
    "  - **Examples:**\n",
    "    - If the answer is **“movies”**, “film”, “films”, “cinema” are not allowed; “moving image”, “on-screen story”, “visual narrative” are acceptable.\n",
    "    - If the answer is **“moon landing”**, “lunar”, “moon”, or “Apollo” are not allowed; “Earth’s natural satellite mission”, “giant leap beyond our planet” are acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Misinformed: Vague and ambiguous clues that are true for ALL answer choices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - CORE PRINCIPLE: Write clues that are factually true for the correct answer AND all wrong answers simultaneously. This creates genuine ambiguity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - CRITICAL RULE: Each clue MUST be 100% true for every single choice. If a clue only applies to some options, it fails.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - 3-STEP PROCESS (before writing each clue):\n",
    "    1. Find what is TRUE about ALL options (the shared intersection)\n",
    "    2. Confirm it's true for the correct answer AND every wrong answer\n",
    "    3. Write the clue using ONLY that shared attributes\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - WHAT TO FOCUS ON:\n",
    "    - Emotional feelings (e.g., \"evokes nostalgia\", \"creates suspense\")\n",
    "    - Format/medium traits (e.g., \"uses visuals\", \"has dialogue\")\n",
    "    - Universal themes (e.g., \"explores conflict\", \"features characters\")\n",
    "    - Audience response (e.g., \"engages viewers\", \"surprises audiences\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - WHAT TO AVOID:\n",
    "    - Plot points, character names, dates, specific events\n",
    "    - Anything true for only 1-2 choices\n",
    "    - Anything that distinguishes between options\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - QUICK EXAMPLES:\n",
    "    - ✅ \"A media form that tells a story and engages audiences.\" (True for: song, book, film - all tell stories)\n",
    "    - ✅ \"Uses artistic expression to convey emotion.\" (True for: painting, sculpture, music - all are artistic)\n",
    "    - ❌ \"Features a protagonist overcoming obstacles.\" (Only true for some - too specific)\n",
    "    - ❌ \"Was released in the 1980s.\" (Only true for certain choices - eliminates others)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fake: Deceptive clues that **strongly and plausibly point toward one of the incorrect answer choices**, but have **no genuine connection** to the correct answer itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - These clues should:\n",
    "    1. Clearly align with the theme, event, or nature of one of the *incorrect* answers.  \n",
    "    2. Avoid referencing or overlapping with any factual, thematic, or contextual aspects of the *correct* answer.  \n",
    "    3. Never describe something that doesn’t correspond to *any* of the given answer choices — every fake clue must be misleading *within the scope of existing options*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Example (answer: \"Moon Landing (1969)\", choices: \"Apollo 13\", \"Moon Landing 1969\", \"The Wright Brothers’ First Flight\"):\n",
    "    - **Correct fake clue:** “Engineers race against time as oxygen runs out aboard a spacecraft stranded millions of miles from Earth.”  \n",
    "      (Relates to *Apollo 13*, but not to *Moon Landing 1969* or *The Wright Brothers*.)  \n",
    "    - **Incorrect fake clue:** “A dramatic account of a historical battle between two warring factions, emphasizing strategy and valor.”  \n",
    "      (Unrelated to *any* of the given answer choices — fails to mislead effectively.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a game master, given a category and a thing (e.g. Movie: The Dark Knight (2008)), for each round, generate:\n",
    "- 9 informed clues for the regular players. Make the clues to be as distinct as possible.\n",
    "- 1 extra informed clue for a backup.\n",
    "- 2 misinformed clues.\n",
    "- 3 fake clues\n",
    "- **Do NOT generate new answers or choices, use only the provided ones from the input.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For round 2, make sure it is subtle enough. For example, when generating clues for a movie:\n",
    "- No direct names.\n",
    "- No title references.\n",
    "- Focus on plot nuances, secondary characters, or themes instead of iconic moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CRITICAL: EVERY SINGLE CLUE MUST BE EXACTLY 15-20 WORDS. NO EXCEPTIONS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your response, you MUST:\n",
    "1. Count every word in every clue individually\n",
    "3. Verify ALL 30 clues fall within 15-20 words\n",
    "4. If even ONE clue is outside range, STOP and rewrite ONLY that clue\n",
    "5. Repeat until 100% pass validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of VALID clues (count the words):\n",
    "- \"The protagonist discovers a hidden power while fleeing from mysterious pursuers in an ancient temple underground.\" (15 words)\n",
    "- \"Betrayal and redemption intertwine as characters navigate political conflicts involving espionage international borders and moral dilemmas.\" (16 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of INVALID clues (DO NOT USE):\n",
    "- \"This film explores themes that are quite complex and multifaceted in nature and shows characters.\" (14 words)\n",
    "- \"The protagonist faces numerous challenges while trying to achieve their goal against overwhelming odds in a fantasy world with magic and danger.\" (21 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some restrictions that you must follow:\n",
    "- You must not mention the answer choices except for the true answer.\n",
    "- The disinformer is not aware which clues are the misinformed ones. So, avoid giving advice that aims to leverage the misinformed clues\n",

    "### Post-Processing Validation Strategy with GLOBAL Batch Fixing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook now implements a **GLOBAL batch fixing** approach to minimize API calls and avoid rate limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. **Generate all clues** - LLM generates clues for ALL 10 test topics (10 API calls)\n",
    "2. **Validate all clues** - Parse JSON and count words for each clue across all tests\n",
    "3. **Collect ALL invalid clues** - Gather invalid clues from ALL tests/rounds into one list\n",
    "4. **SINGLE GLOBAL batch fix** - Make **ONE API call** to rewrite ALL invalid clues at once\n",
    "5. **Distribute fixes** - Apply rewritten clues back to their respective tests/rounds\n",
    "6. **Report** - Generate comprehensive validation summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Maximum API efficiency**: 11 total API calls (10 generations + 1 batch fix) instead of up to 38 calls (10 generations + 28 individual fixes)\n",
    "- ✅ **Rate limit friendly**: Drastically reduces RPM (requests per minute) usage\n",
    "- ✅ **Cost efficient**: ~73% reduction in API calls for typical workloads\n",
    "- ✅ **Faster**: No sequential waiting between individual clue fixes\n",

    "**Pipeline Stages:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "PHASE 1: Generate & Validate All Tests (10 API calls)\n",
    "  ↓ Collect invalid clues from all tests\n",
    "  \n",
    "PHASE 2: Global Batch Fix (1 API call)\n",
    "  ↓ Rewrite ALL invalid clues in single request\n",
    "  \n",
    "PHASE 3: Apply Fixes\n",
    "  ↓ Distribute rewritten clues to their tests\n",

    "| Approach | Generation | Per-Test Batch | Global Batch | Total |\n",
    "|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Old (Per-Clue)** | 10 | - | - | 10 + N invalid |\n",

    "**Example Savings:**\n",
    "- 20 invalid clues across 10 tests:\n",
    "  - Old: 30 API calls (10 gen + 20 fixes)\n",
    "  - Per-test: 20 API calls (10 gen + 10 batch)\n",
    "  - **Global: 11 API calls (10 gen + 1 batch)** ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Functions:**\n",
    "- `validate_clue_word_count()` - Check if a single clue meets requirements\n",
    "- `batch_rewrite_clues_with_llm()` - Rewrite multiple clues in one API call (now supports cross-test batching)\n",
    "- `validate_and_fix_game_data()` - Validate clues and collect invalid ones (no longer fixes immediately)\n",
    "- Main execution loop - 3-phase approach: generate all → batch fix all → apply all\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Changes in This Version\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **GLOBAL BATCHING**: All invalid clues from ALL tests are fixed in ONE API call\n",
    "✅ **Maximum Rate Limit Relief**: 63-73% fewer API calls vs previous versions\n",
    "✅ **Automatic**: No configuration needed - just run the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Global Batching Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Phase 1: Generate & validate all tests (collect invalid clues)\n",
    "for test in game_topics:\n",
    "    game_data = model.invoke(...)  # API call\n",
    "    invalid_clues.extend(validate(...))  # Collect, don't fix\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 2: ONE batch fix for ALL invalid clues\n",
    "rewritten = batch_rewrite_clues_with_llm(all_invalid_clues, model)  # Single API call\n",
    "\n",
    "# Phase 3: Apply fixes back to their original locations\n",
    "for i, clue in enumerate(rewritten):\n",
    "    game_data[test][round][type][idx] = clue\n",
    "```\n",
