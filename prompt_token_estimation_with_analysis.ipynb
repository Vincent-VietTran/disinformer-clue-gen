    "```\n",
    "In this cooperative game, players use communication and teamwork to uncover the original prompt over multiple rounds of clues. Along the way, they must contend with a disruptive “Disinformer,” varying player interpretations, and time limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a minimum of 3 players and maximum of 10 players:\n",
    "- Regular players (a.k.a. the netizens): The job is to solve clues and discover the original prompt\n",
    "- at most 2 misinformed players: Has the same job as the regular players. However, this player is unknowingly being given vague/ambiguous clues.\n",
    "- at most 2 disinformer players: The job is to solve clues and discover prompt to persuade other players from clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be 2 rounds in each game.\n",
    "- In the first round, the players will be given clues to guess a general category/term (e.g. \"movie\", \"song\", \"novel\", etc)\n",
    "- In the second round, the players will be given clues to guess a more specific thing (e.g. \"The Dark Knight (2008)\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Novel)\", \"Space Oddity - David Bowie (1969)\", etc) which is related to the general category in the previous round.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each round, there will be 3 type of clues for each player:\n",
    "- Informed: Not-so-easy but unambiguous clues.\n",
    "- Misinformed: Ambiguous/vague clues that may potentially make them think an entirely different guess (intended for the misinformed player).\n",
    "- Fake: Clues that point to one of the wrong answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in each round, the players will be given 10 minutes to discuss their guess. If they stuck, they may ask the game master to reveal an additional clue to help them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a game master, given a category and a thing (e.g. Movie: The Dark Knight (2008)), for each round, generate:\n",
    "- 9 informed clues for the regular players. Make the clues to be as distinct as possible.\n",
    "- 1 extra informed clue for a backup.\n",
    "- 2 misinformed clues.\n",
    "- 2 fake clues\n",
    "- Also, the answer choices for that round (3 choices)\n",
    "\n",
    "For round 2, make sure it is subtle enough. For example, when generating clues for a movie:\n",
    "- No direct names.\n",
    "- No title references.\n",
    "- Focus on plot nuances, secondary characters, or themes instead of iconic moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the clues you generated, make sure it is between 15-20 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you also need to provide 3 instructions to help the disinformer.\n",
    "Based on the set of informed and misinformed clues you have came up with, using the Polarisation strategy, generate 3 instructions to help the disinformer player.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some restrictions that you must follow:\n",
    "- You must not mention the answer choices except for the true answer.\n",
    "- The disinformer is not aware which clues are the misinformed ones. So, avoid giving advice that aims to leverage the misinformed clues\n",

    "- **Run Subsets**: For experimentation, run only a few test topics at a time (e.g., change `test_topics[:3]` to run first 3).\n",
    "- **Increase Delays**: The notebook now uses longer sleeps (10s for generation, 5s for analysis).\n",
    "- **Reduce Retries**: Limited to 2 attempts per test.\n",
