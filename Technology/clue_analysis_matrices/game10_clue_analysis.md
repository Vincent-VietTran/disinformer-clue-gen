| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They focus on the core functionality of connecting people with drivers for transportation. Some clues are a bit repetitive in theme but overall good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are very general and could apply to many digital services. They are factually true for Ride-Sharing, Food Delivery, and Navigation Apps, but lack the specificity to be 'productively ambiguous'. They are almost too vague to be helpful in creating confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Food Delivery' and the second strongly points to 'Navigation App', effectively drawing attention away from 'Ride-Sharing'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are well-crafted and the fake clues are highly effective misdirections. The misinformed clues could be improved by being slightly more specific while still maintaining ambiguity across all choices.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. They effectively describe Uber's pioneering role, expansion, and impact on urban mobility. The variety of angles covered (industry impact, app revolution, service offerings) is good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Uber, Lyft, Grab) and are general enough not to point to any single option specifically. They are not overly vague, providing a reasonable level of shared truth.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly deceptive. They use terms like 'ride-hailing services' and 'extensive network of drivers' which could strongly point towards Lyft or Grab, while avoiding any specific details that would link them to Uber. They are designed to misdirect effectively.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are quite strong and specific to Uber, while the misinformed clues are general enough to apply to all.

This mix creates a moderate level of difficulty, where a player needs to parse the nuances of the informed clues to confirm the answer, and be wary of the misdirection in the fake clues.
