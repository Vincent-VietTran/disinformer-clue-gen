# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 6 | Round 1: Technology**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 93% (13/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 1/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Clues are specific and avoid answer contamination. They cover different aspects of the payment system. Clue 8 is slightly long but acceptable.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The misinformed clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. They could be true for many things beyond the given choices, making them less effective at confusing the player. 'Digital tools and systems' and 'exchange value' are extremely broad.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. They directly and accurately describe the incorrect choices ('Cryptocurrency' and 'Banking App') and are completely unrelated to the correct answer ('Payment System').

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

---

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The strong fake clues and decent informed clues balance out the weak misinformed clues, leading to a moderate difficulty level. Players will need to carefully distinguish between the specific functions of a payment system and the broader definitions of the other options, while also being misled by the fake clues.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The fake clues are the strongest element of this set, effectively misdirecting players. The informed clues are good, providing specific details. The misinformed clues need significant improvement to create more targeted ambiguity without being too vague.
