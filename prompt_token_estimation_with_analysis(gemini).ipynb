        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate clues** - LLM generates all clues in JSON format\n",
        "2. **Parse and validate** - Extract JSON and count words for each clue\n",
        "3. **Automatic fixing** - For non-compliant clues (not 15-20 words):\n",
        "   - Make a targeted LLM call to rewrite only that specific clue\n",
        "   - Preserve the clue's core meaning and type (informed/misinformed/fake)\n",
        "   - Retry up to 3 times if needed\n",
        "4. **Replace** - Update the game data with corrected clues\n",
        "5. **Report** - Generate a validation summary showing compliance rates and fixes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Functions:**\n",
        "- `validate_clue_word_count()` - Check if a single clue meets requirements\n",
        "- `rewrite_clue_with_llm()` - Ask LLM to rewrite a non-compliant clue\n",
        "- `validate_and_fix_game_data()` - Validate all clues and auto-fix issues\n",
        "- `manual_fix_clues()` - Interactive manual validation and fixing\n",
