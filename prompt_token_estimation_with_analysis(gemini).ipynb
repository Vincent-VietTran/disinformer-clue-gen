        "\n",
        "This notebook now implements a robust post-processing approach with **batch fixing** to avoid rate limits:\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate clues** - LLM generates all clues in JSON format\n",
        "2. **Parse and validate** - Extract JSON and count words for each clue\n",
        "3. **Collect invalid clues** - Gather all non-compliant clues (not 15-20 words) during validation\n",
        "4. **Batch fixing** - For all invalid clues:\n",
        "   - Make a **SINGLE** LLM call to rewrite ALL invalid clues at once\n",
        "   - Preserve each clue's core meaning and type (informed/misinformed/fake)\n",
        "   - Retry the entire batch up to 3 times if needed\n",
        "5. **Replace** - Update the game data with corrected clues\n",
        "6. **Report** - Generate a validation summary showing compliance rates and fixes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Advantages:**\n",
        "- ✅ **Rate limit friendly**: 1 API call per game instead of 1 per clue\n",
        "- ✅ **Faster**: Parallel processing by the LLM\n",
        "- ✅ **Cost efficient**: Fewer API calls = lower costs\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Functions:**\n",
        "- `validate_clue_word_count()` - Check if a single clue meets requirements\n",
        "- `batch_rewrite_clues_with_llm()` - Ask LLM to rewrite ALL invalid clues in one call\n",
        "- `validate_and_fix_game_data()` - Validate all clues and batch auto-fix issues\n",
        "- `manual_fix_clues()` - Interactive manual validation and fixing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Automatic batch fixing (default - RECOMMENDED)\n",
        "corrected_data, report = validate_and_fix_game_data(game_data, model, auto_fix=True)\n",
