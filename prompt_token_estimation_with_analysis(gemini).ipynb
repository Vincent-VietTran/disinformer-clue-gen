        "\n",
        "This notebook now implements a **GLOBAL batch fixing** approach to minimize API calls and avoid rate limits:\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "1. **Generate all clues** - LLM generates clues for ALL 10 test topics (10 API calls)\n",
        "2. **Validate all clues** - Parse JSON and count words for each clue across all tests\n",
        "3. **Collect ALL invalid clues** - Gather invalid clues from ALL tests/rounds into one list\n",
        "4. **SINGLE GLOBAL batch fix** - Make **ONE API call** to rewrite ALL invalid clues at once\n",
        "5. **Distribute fixes** - Apply rewritten clues back to their respective tests/rounds\n",
        "6. **Report** - Generate comprehensive validation summary\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Advantages:**\n",
        "- ✅ **Maximum API efficiency**: 11 total API calls (10 generations + 1 batch fix) instead of up to 38 calls (10 generations + 28 individual fixes)\n",
        "- ✅ **Rate limit friendly**: Drastically reduces RPM (requests per minute) usage\n",
        "- ✅ **Cost efficient**: ~73% reduction in API calls for typical workloads\n",
        "- ✅ **Faster**: No sequential waiting between individual clue fixes\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pipeline Stages:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "PHASE 1: Generate & Validate All Tests (10 API calls)\n",
        "  ↓ Collect invalid clues from all tests\n",
        "  \n",
        "PHASE 2: Global Batch Fix (1 API call)\n",
        "  ↓ Rewrite ALL invalid clues in single request\n",
        "  \n",
        "PHASE 3: Apply Fixes\n",
        "  ↓ Distribute rewritten clues to their tests\n",
        "  \n",
        "PHASE 4: Generate Reports\n",
        "  ↓ Save CSV files with validation metrics\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**API Call Comparison:**\n",
        "\n",
        "| Approach | Generation | Per-Test Batch | Global Batch | Total |\n",
        "|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|-------|\n",
        "| **Old (Per-Clue)** | 10 | - | - | 10 + N invalid |\n",
        "| **Per-Test Batch** | 10 | 10 (1 per test) | - | 20 |\n",
        "| **Global Batch** ✅ | 10 | - | 1 | **11** |\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Savings:**\n",
        "- 20 invalid clues across 10 tests:\n",
        "  - Old: 30 API calls (10 gen + 20 fixes)\n",
        "  - Per-test: 20 API calls (10 gen + 10 batch)\n",
        "  - **Global: 11 API calls (10 gen + 1 batch)** ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Functions:**\n",
        "- `validate_clue_word_count()` - Check if a single clue meets requirements\n",
        "- `batch_rewrite_clues_with_llm()` - Rewrite multiple clues in one API call (now supports cross-test batching)\n",
        "- `validate_and_fix_game_data()` - Validate clues and collect invalid ones (no longer fixes immediately)\n",
        "- Main execution loop - 3-phase approach: generate all → batch fix all → apply all\n",
        "\n",
        "**Usage:**\n",
        "The notebook automatically runs the global batch strategy. No configuration needed!\n"

        "✅ **GLOBAL BATCHING**: All invalid clues from ALL tests are fixed in ONE API call\n",

        "# Phase 2: ONE batch fix for ALL invalid clues\n",
