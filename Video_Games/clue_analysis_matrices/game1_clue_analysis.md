---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to RPGs, covering character creation, progression, storytelling, world exploration, attribute management, dialogue impact, crafting, lore, and combat variety. They avoid general terms that could apply to other genres.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. 'Exploring large areas and having interactions' could apply to Adventure, but 'story that they can interact with and influence directly' leans more towards RPGs or Adventure, not necessarily Strategy. They lack the necessary shared truth across all options.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues effectively describe Strategy games by focusing on resource management, armies, territories, and strategic battles. They are completely unrelated to RPGs and provide strong misdirection towards the Strategy choice.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it easy to identify the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too weak to cause confusion, and the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to Strategy. This combination makes the game relatively easy.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to RPGs. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting to Strategy. However, the misinformed clues are too weak and do not meet the criteria for productive ambiguity, failing to be true for all incorrect options. This makes the game lean towards being too easy.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' without using answer words or direct synonyms. They highlight key mechanics and narrative elements unique to the game, such as the silent protagonist, physics-based puzzles, resource gathering for survival, open-world freedom, and environmental storytelling. The clues cover diverse aspects of the gameplay and narrative, providing a clear but not overly obvious path to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too general and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'Players can collect items, solve puzzles, and engage in combat against enemies throughout the game' is true for Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, but the phrasing isn't specific enough to be considered a good misinformed clue. They lack the productive ambiguity needed to confuse players between the choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue, 'Players navigate challenging terrain, establishing settlements and managing resources to survive harsh environmental circumstances and conditions,' strongly points to games like survival or strategy games, potentially misdirecting towards something like a fictional 'settlement' game, but not specifically Elden Ring or Baldur's Gate 3. The second fake clue, 'The game focuses on strategic combat, requiring players to command armies and conquer rival factions,' is a very strong misdirection towards a grand strategy or RTS game, completely avoiding the correct answer and plausibly pointing to hypothetical incorrect choices not present, but effectively misdirecting away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing precise details about 'The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild' without revealing the answer. The fake clues are effective at misdirecting players away from the correct answer. The misinformed clues need significant improvement to meet the criteria of being true for all choices and creating productive ambiguity.
