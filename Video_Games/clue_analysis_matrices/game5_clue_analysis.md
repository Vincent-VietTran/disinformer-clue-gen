# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 5 | Round 1: Video Games**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.9 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are highly specific to Adventure and avoid direct synonyms. They cover exploration, journey, obstacles, skill gain, narrative focus, freedom, character interaction, and clear goals, all strong indicators of Adventure. They do not contaminate the answer word.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too general. 'Player character', 'virtual environment', 'interacting with the world and its inhabitants', and 'narrative with its own unique plot elements' are true for almost all video game genres, including Adventure, RPG, and Action. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so broad they don't help differentiate between the choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. 'Complex character customization options and extensive skill trees' strongly points to RPG. 'Dynamic combat system with real-time battles that emphasize player skill and strategy' strongly points to Action. Neither is characteristic of Adventure, thus effectively misdirecting away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear for someone familiar with game genres. However, the fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards RPG and Action, which adds a layer of challenge. The misinformed clues are too vague to be helpful or harmful.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are well-crafted and clearly point to 'Adventure'. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'RPG' and 'Action'. The misinformed clues are too general to be useful. The difficulty is moderate, leaning towards easier due to the strength of the informed clues, but balanced by the strong fake clues.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

✅ Strengths:

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**
