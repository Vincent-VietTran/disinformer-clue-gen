They are completely unrelated to RPGs and provide strong misdirection towards the Strategy choice.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it easy to identify the correct answer.

The clues cover diverse aspects of the gameplay and narrative, providing a clear but not overly obvious path to the correct answer.",1,"These clues are too general and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'Players can collect items, solve puzzles, and engage in combat against enemies throughout the game' is true for Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3, but the phrasing isn't specific enough to be considered a good misinformed clue. They lack the productive ambiguity needed to confuse players between the choices.",5,"The first fake clue, 'Players navigate challenging terrain, establishing settlements and managing resources to survive harsh environmental circumstances and conditions,' strongly points to games like survival or strategy games, potentially misdirecting towards something like a fictional 'settlement' game, but not specifically Elden Ring or Baldur's Gate 3. The second fake clue, 'The game focuses on strategic combat, requiring players to command armies and conquer rival factions,' is a very strong misdirection towards a grand strategy or RTS game, completely avoiding the correct answer and plausibly pointing to hypothetical incorrect choices not present, but effectively misdirecting away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players to the correct answer, while the fake clues provide plausible misdirection.

Neither clue relates to 'Shooter' in a defining way.",,2,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer.

'Close-quarters battles, utilizing special moves and combos' strongly points to fighting games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, which are not choices.

4,Video Games,1,Shooter,"Shooter, Fighting, Sports",4,"The clues are good and descriptive of Shooters without using direct keywords. They focus on core mechanics and objectives.
