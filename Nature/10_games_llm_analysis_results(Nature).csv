1,Nature,1,Mammal,"Invertebrates, Mammal, Vertebrates",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise terminology like 'hair or fur', 'nourished with milk', 'warm-blooded', 'four-chambered heart', and 'neocortex'. They avoid using any part of the answer word or its direct synonyms. Each clue points strongly and uniquely to 'Mammal'.",2,"The provided misinformed clues are too general and do not create effective ambiguity. 'This is a type of animal that exists in diverse habitats around the world, from forests to oceans.' and 'These creatures are complex organisms with various biological systems that interact to keep them alive.' are true for all three choices (Invertebrates, Mammal, Vertebrates) but lack any specific shared characteristics that would make them plausibly misleading. They are true but unhelpfully so. They do not create productive confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. 'They often have exoskeletons that provide protection and support, and they molt as they grow bigger.' and 'These creatures' bodies are segmented, and they are typically protected by a hard, external covering, an exoskeleton structure.' directly and strongly describe 'Invertebrates' (specifically arthropods), making them highly plausible for the incorrect choice and completely irrelevant to the correct answer 'Mammal'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer clear to anyone familiar with basic biology. The misinformed clues are too weak to cause confusion. The fake clues are strong misdirection towards 'Invertebrates'. The difficulty is balanced by the strong fake clues, which might lead some players astray momentarily, but the clear informed clues should eventually guide them to the correct answer. It's a moderately challenging puzzle.",The informed and fake clues are very well-crafted and serve their intended purposes. The misinformed clues need to be more ambiguous and shared across all options to be effective. The overall quality is high due to the strong informed and fake clues.,14,14,100%,16.4
1,Nature,2,African Elephant,"giraffe, African Elephant, Lion",5,"The clues are highly specific and accurately describe the African Elephant without using any of the answer words or obvious synonyms. They cover a range of distinct characteristics, from physical features to social behavior and ecological role.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers. 'Large animal that lives in Africa' is true for African Elephant and Lion, but not Giraffe. 'Consume sustenance and use resources' is true for all living things, making it extremely vague and not productively ambiguous.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue perfectly describes a giraffe, and the second clue perfectly describes a lion, making them strong decoys.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong, pointing clearly to the correct answer for those who know the characteristics of an African Elephant. However, the presence of two very strong fake clues that directly describe the incorrect options adds a good layer of challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and specific. The fake clues are very well-crafted to misdirect towards the incorrect options. The misinformed clues are the weakest part, failing to meet the criteria for ambiguity and shared truth across all choices.",14,14,100%,16.2
2,Nature,1,Fruits,"Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers",5,"Clues are highly specific to fruits, using botanical definitions and common consumption patterns without using the word 'fruit' or its direct synonyms. They cover various aspects like origin, usage, nutritional value, appearance, and dispersal mechanisms effectively.",1,"These clues are too specific to 'vegetables' and 'flowers' respectively, failing the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. They do not create productive ambiguity as they directly point away from 'Fruits'.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue perfectly describes 'Vegetables' by focusing on edible roots, stems, and leaves, and their savory use. The second clue strongly points to 'Flowers' by highlighting their color, role in attracting pollinators, and decorative use. Neither clue has any overlap with 'Fruits'.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong, making it relatively easy to identify 'Fruits'. However, the fake clues are so effective at misdirecting to 'Vegetables' and 'Flowers' that a player might get confused if they don't carefully analyze the informed clues against all options. This creates a good level of challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are exceptionally well-crafted to target the incorrect answers without any overlap with the correct answer. The misinformed clues fail completely, being too specific to incorrect answers rather than being ambiguous. The overall game is challenging due to the strong fake clues.",14,14,100%,16.1
2,Nature,2,Apple,"Apple, Banana, Watermelon",5,"The clues are highly specific and avoid any mention of the answer word or its synonyms. They cover various aspects like origin, cultural significance, and common uses. The clue about the tech company logo is particularly strong for Apple.",3,"The misinformed clues are true for all options, but perhaps a bit too general. 'Healthy and nutritious' and 'source of vitamins' apply to all three fruits. They create some ambiguity but could be slightly more subtly worded to be more productive.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first strongly points to Banana, and the second strongly points to Watermelon, effectively diverting attention from Apple.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong, but the misinformed and fake clues introduce enough ambiguity and misdirection to make it a balanced challenge.","A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are precise and varied, while the fake clues are highly effective misdirectors. The misinformed clues are functional but could be slightly refined for greater ambiguity.",14,14,100%,16.7
3,Nature,1,Insects,"Insects, Arachnids, Myriapods",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately detailing characteristics unique to insects without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover morphology, life cycle, ecological roles, and physiological features. Each clue points directly to 'Insects' and effectively eliminates 'Arachnids' and 'Myriapods'.",1,"These clues are too vague and not factually true for all incorrect answers. For example, 'These organisms, essential to ecological balance, play vital roles and interact with other species in their environments' is true for insects, arachnids, and myriapods, but the other clue ('These organisms, through their lifecycles, grow and develop, requiring resources and adapting to their surroundings within ecosystems') is also too general. The goal of misinformed clues is to be true for ALL options, and these are not sufficiently broad or shared.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue ('These creatures have eight legs and two body segments, often associated with webs and venom.') perfectly describes arachnids. The second clue ('These creatures, often found in damp places, are characterized by multiple body segments and numerous appendages.') strongly points to myriapods (like centipedes and millipedes). They are plausible and avoid any connection to insects.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer clear if one knows about insects. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting. The misinformed clues are weak and fail to create ambiguity, which slightly lowers the overall difficulty. However, a player would still need to differentiate between the specific informed clues and the targeted fake clues.","The informed and fake clues are of high quality and serve their intended purposes well. The misinformed clues are too weak and fail to meet the criteria for productive ambiguity, being too general and not universally true for all options in a shared way. This significantly impacts the game's intended balance.",14,14,100%,16.1
3,Nature,2,Monarch Butterfly,"Monarch Butterfly, Honey Bee, Ladybug",5,"Clues are highly specific to the Monarch Butterfly, describing its unique coloration, migration, larval diet, metamorphosis, and wing structure. They avoid any overlap with the other choices.",1,"These clues are not factually true for all incorrect answers. 'This insect is a pollinator' is not true for Ladybugs. 'This insect's primary food source is nectar' is not true for Ladybugs. Therefore, these clues fail the critical requirement of being true for all options, making them closer to 'informed' than 'misinformed'.",5,"The first fake clue ('social behavior, living in hives and working together to produce honey') strongly points to Honey Bee. The second fake clue ('red and black coloration is iconic, often found in gardens, consuming other pests') strongly points to Ladybug. Both are highly effective misdirections away from the Monarch Butterfly.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. However, the presence of fake clues that are highly plausible for the incorrect answers, combined with the failure of the misinformed clues to be truly ambiguous, elevates the difficulty slightly by attempting to pull the player towards incorrect answers.","The informed clues are excellent and clearly identify the Monarch Butterfly. The fake clues are also very strong and effectively misdirect towards the Honey Bee and Ladybug. The misinformed clues are problematic as they are not universally true for all choices, undermining their intended ambiguity. The difficulty is moderate to high due to the strong fake clues and the potential confusion they create, even though the informed clues are very clear.",14,14,100%,16.1
4,Nature,1,Fish,"Fish, Reptiles, Amphibians",4,"The clues are quite specific to fish, using terms like 'gills', 'scales', 'fins', and 'aquatic vertebrates'. They avoid direct answer contamination and offer distinct descriptive angles. The only slight weakness is that 'gills' might be too direct a giveaway, but it's a core characteristic.",3,"The misinformed clues are very general, stating that the creatures are alive, part of the natural world, and have biological needs and adaptations. These are true for fish, reptiles, and amphibians, creating ambiguity. However, they are a bit too generic and don't strongly lean towards any specific incorrect answer over another, making the ambiguity less 'productive' and more just broadly applicable.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue perfectly describes reptiles ('dry, scaly skin', 'basking in the sun'). The second clue strongly points to amphibians ('transformation', 'aquatic larvae', 'terrestrial adults'). They completely avoid any connection to fish.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to identify the correct answer, but the misinformed and fake clues provide enough plausible distraction to require careful consideration. The fake clues are particularly effective at misdirection, increasing the challenge.","A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues clearly describe 'Fish' without explicit contamination. The misinformed clues are appropriately vague and true for all options.

4,Nature,2,Dolphin,"Dolphin, Shark, Whale",4,"The clues are descriptive and accurately point to the dolphin without using direct keywords. They cover intelligence, communication, social behavior, and physical adaptations. There's a slight overlap in the 'social animal' and 'intelligent' clues with whales, but the combination strongly favors dolphins.",2,"These clues are too general and don't create productive ambiguity. They are true for all marine animals, including dolphins, sharks, and whales, making them almost useless for the game's purpose of creating confusion between specific choices.",5,"These clues are excellent for misdirection. The first clue strongly points to a shark, and the second strongly points to a whale, effectively drawing attention away from the correct answer, dolphin.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players towards the correct answer, but the fake clues provide strong misdirection. The misinformed clues are too weak to significantly impact difficulty.","The informed clues are good, and the fake clues are excellent. The misinformed clues need improvement to be more ambiguous and confusing.",15,15,100%,17.5
5,Nature,1,Crustaceans,"Crustaceans, Reptiles, Arachnids",4,"Clues are specific to crustaceans. 'Exoskeletons', 'molt', 'segmented bodies and multiple pairs of legs', and 'hard shells' are strong indicators. 'Regenerate lost limbs' is also a good clue. The clues avoid answer contamination.",1,"These clues are not factually true for all choices. The first clue, 'These creatures are a diverse group of animals, found in various habitats around the world, adapting to many biomes,' is true for crustaceans, reptiles, and arachnids. However, the second clue, 'They are cold-blooded creatures, that are invertebrates, and are found in many different types of habitats,' is problematic. While crustaceans and arachnids are invertebrates, reptiles are vertebrates. This makes the clue not factually true for all incorrect answers and therefore not maximally ambiguous as required.",5,"The first fake clue ('scales', 'lay eggs', 'warm, sunny environments') strongly points to reptiles. The second fake clue ('four pairs of legs', 'spin webs') strongly points to arachnids. Both are excellent misdirections away from crustaceans.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong and specific to crustaceans, making them relatively easy to identify if one has some biological knowledge. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting towards reptiles and arachnids, adding a layer of difficulty.

5,Nature,2,crabs,"lobsters, Crabs, Shrimps",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They focus on distinct characteristics of crabs, such as sideways movement, claws, exoskeleton, and habitat. Some clues are quite specific to crabs.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general and don't create productive ambiguity. 'Hard outer shell' and 'aquatic environments' apply to lobsters and shrimps equally, but the clues lack specific details that would make them plausibly point to any of the incorrect options while still being true for crabs. They are true but not effectively ambiguous.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first clue ('long necks and slow movements, often associated with ancient times') strongly points to dinosaurs, which is not an option, but it's designed to distract. The second clue ('ability to fly and build nests') points to birds, also not an option, but a strong misdirection. They are completely unrelated to crabs and the other choices.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide players towards the correct answer, but the misinformed clues are too vague to cause significant confusion. The fake clues are strong distractors. The difficulty feels balanced.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to crabs.

6,Nature,1,Mollusks,"Mollusks, Echinoderms, Cnidarians",5,"The clues are highly specific and directly descriptive of mollusks without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like morphology, habitat, locomotion, and feeding, providing strong evidence for the correct answer.",1,"These clues are too vague and could apply to a vast array of aquatic life, not just the specific incorrect choices provided. They don't create productive ambiguity among the given options.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. Radial symmetry is a hallmark of Echinoderms, and stinging cells (cnidocytes) are a defining characteristic of Cnidarians, directly pointing players away from Mollusks.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong, and the fake clues are highly specific to incorrect answers. This makes the puzzle relatively easy to solve for someone with basic biological knowledge.","The informed clues are well-crafted and highly specific to the answer. The fake clues are excellent misdirection, targeting specific incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are too general and do not contribute to ambiguity among the given choices.

6,Nature,2,Snails,"Octopus, Snails, Clams",5,"Clues are highly specific to snails and avoid any overlap with octopuses or clams. They cover distinct aspects like movement, shell, habitat, diet, and reproduction, providing a strong basis for identifying snails without explicitly naming them.",2,"The misinformed clues are too general and don't create productive ambiguity. 'Aquatic animals' is true for octopus but not snails or clams. 'Need for sustenance, engaging in growth and reproduction' is true for all three. The lack of shared factual truth for all options makes them ineffective for misdirection.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. 'Intelligence and behaviors, including camouflage skills' strongly points to octopus. 'Regenerate lost body parts' also strongly suggests octopus. They completely avoid any connection to snails.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable. However, the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the octopus, and the misinformed clues are weak, which balances the difficulty to a moderate level. A player needs to carefully parse the informed clues while resisting the strong pull of the fake ones.","The informed clues are excellent, precise, and descriptive.

They are factually true for all but offer no productive ambiguity.",1,"The fake clues are completely ineffective. 'Complex social structures, living in colonies with specialized roles' strongly points to insects (like ants or bees) and not arachnids or myriapods. 'Undergoing a process of change' from youth to adulthood is a defining characteristic of insects (metamorphosis) and not typically how arachnids or myriapods develop. These clues do not point to any incorrect choice plausibly and actively misdirect away from the correct answer.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer once all clues are considered.

'Invertebrates' and 'exoskeletons' apply to all three choices. 'Variety of habitats' is also too broad. The clues do not effectively point to the correct answer or mislead away from it.,5,"These clues strongly and plausibly describe scorpions (segmented bodies, metamorphosis is less typical for scorpions but some might consider larval stages in a broad sense, or it might be a general invertebrate clue). They effectively misdirect away from spiders and mites.",,3,The informed clues are strong and point to the correct answer. The fake clues provide good misdirection to incorrect answers.

They cover various aspects like thermoregulation, physical characteristics, habitat, life cycle, and evolutionary history. The clues are distinct and offer multiple angles to identify the correct answer.",2,"These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While factually true for reptiles, they are also overwhelmingly true for amphibians, making them not maximally ambiguous. They lean too heavily towards being true for a broader category rather than creating confusion between reptiles and fish/amphibians specifically.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Fish' and to some extent 'Amphibians'. They describe aquatic adaptations and roles in food chains, which are not primary characteristics of reptiles as a whole, thus strongly pointing away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, while the fake clues provide good misdirection.

For example, 'cold-blooded and are often found in warmer, sunny environments' is true for lizards and turtles, but 'often found in various habitats, including both water and on land around the world' is also true for lizards and turtles. The problem is that these clues are not *maximally* ambiguous as required, and they don't create productive confusion because they are so generic.",5,"The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. 'Vibrant colors and ability to change hues' strongly points to some lizards. 'Ability to climb trees' also strongly points to lizards, and potentially some turtles to a lesser extent, effectively drawing attention away from crocodiles.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, and the fake clues provide good misdirection. The misinformed clues are weak, which slightly lowers the difficulty. However, the overall balance of good informed and fake clues makes it a moderately challenging puzzle.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer without being obvious.
