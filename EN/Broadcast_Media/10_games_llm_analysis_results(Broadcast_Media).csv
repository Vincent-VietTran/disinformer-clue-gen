1,Movie,1,Sci-Fi,"Sci-Fi, Horror, Fantasy",5,"The clues are highly specific to Sci-Fi, using terms like 'technological advancements,' 'futuristic settings,' 'space travel,' 'robots,' 'aliens,' 'artificial intelligence,' and 'speculative concepts.' They avoid any overlap with Horror or Fantasy and do not use the answer word itself or obvious synonyms.",3,"The clues are somewhat ambiguous but could be slightly more productive. 'Features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' is true for Sci-Fi but also strongly for Horror. 'Involves fantastical elements and imaginative creatures' is true for Sci-Fi (aliens, AI can be 'fantastical' in a broad sense) and also Fantasy, but less so for Horror unless it's supernatural horror. The goal is for these to be *equally* true for all options, which is a very high bar. These are decent attempts at shared truth.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Horror ('jump scares,' 'dread and fear') and Fantasy ('mythical creatures,' 'magic spells,' 'enchanted landscapes'). They contain no elements that would suggest Sci-Fi, making them excellent misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one focuses on them. However, the misinformed clues, while not perfectly ambiguous, do add a layer of potential confusion, and the fake clues are strong misdirectors. This combination creates a moderate difficulty level.","The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to Sci-Fi without using forbidden terms. The fake clues are highly effective misdirectors for Horror and Fantasy. The misinformed clues are a good attempt at creating ambiguity, though achieving perfect shared truth across all options is challenging.",15,15,100%,17.5
1,Movie,2,The Matrix,"The Conjuring, The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings",5,"Clues are precise and descriptive without using answer words or synonyms. They cover various aspects of the film, from its philosophical themes to its visual innovations.",3,The clues are factually true for all options but are very general. They lack the specificity to create productive ambiguity and are too vague to strongly point to any incorrect answer over the correct one.,5,"These clues effectively misdirect to 'The Conjuring' and 'The Lord of the Rings' respectively, using core plot elements of those films and avoiding any connection to 'The Matrix'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to identify the correct answer, while the fake clues provide clear misdirection to incorrect options. The misinformed clues are too vague to be helpful or harmful.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes. The misinformed clues could be improved by being slightly more specific while still remaining ambiguous across all options.,15,15,100%,17.1
2,Movie,1,Comedy,"Comedy, Action, Drama",5,The clues are highly specific to the concept of eliciting laughter and amusement through various comedic techniques. They avoid any overlap with the other genres and clearly define the intended answer.,1,"These clues are too specific to the incorrect answers (Drama and Action) and do not share any truth with the correct answer (Comedy). For example, 'complex narratives' and 'character development and conflict' are not universally true for Comedy and are defining features of Drama. 'Complex human emotions and relationships' also leans heavily towards Drama. The clues fail the critical requirement of being true for all options.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards the 'Action' genre ('high-speed chases, explosions, and intense fight sequences') and the 'Drama' genre ('complexities of human relationships and societal issues'). They completely avoid any mention or hint of the correct answer, 'Comedy', making them strongly deceptive.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear. However, the fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues are problematic as they are not true for all options. The balance of strong informed and fake clues with weak misinformed clues makes the overall difficulty moderate.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the correct answer. The fake clues are also very well-crafted for misdirection. The misinformed clues are the weakest aspect, failing to meet the criteria of being true for all options, thus not creating productive ambiguity. The difficulty is moderate due to the strong informed and fake clues balancing out the poor misinformed ones.",14,14,100%,16.2
2,Movie,2,The Hangover,"Die Hard, The Hangover, Forrest Gump",5,The clues are very specific to 'The Hangover' and avoid any answer words or synonyms. They highlight unique plot points and comedic elements that clearly distinguish it from the other options. The variety of clues covers different aspects of the movie's plot and humor.,1,These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being true for ALL incorrect answers AND the correct answer. 'The film centers around a group of friends who embark on a journey filled with obstacles and challenges' could apply to 'Die Hard' but not necessarily 'Forrest Gump' or 'The Hangover' in the same general way. 'The narrative focuses on a group of friends as they navigate through difficult circumstances together' is also too broad and doesn't universally apply to all choices.,5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They strongly point towards 'Forrest Gump' by focusing on a personal journey of self-discovery, facing adversity, and growth, which are core themes of that movie. They completely avoid any elements of 'The Hangover' or 'Die Hard'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer easily identifiable for someone familiar with the movie. However, the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Forrest Gump', creating a good level of challenge for players who might rely on those clues. The misinformed clues are too weak to be effective, but the other clue types balance the difficulty.","The informed clues are top-notch, highly specific and descriptive without using forbidden words. The fake clues are also very strong, effectively misdirecting towards 'Forrest Gump'. The misinformed clues fail to meet the strict criteria for shared truth across all options and are therefore ineffective.

3,Movie,1,Action,"Action, Thriller, Adventure",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Action' by focusing on physical conflict, stunts, high stakes, and clear protagonists overcoming odds, without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively differentiate 'Action' from 'Thriller' and 'Adventure'.",2,"While factually true for all genres, these clues are too general. 'High stakes and suspense' and 'hero facing difficult challenges' could apply to 'Thriller' and 'Adventure' almost as strongly, if not more so, than 'Action' in some interpretations. They don't create strong ambiguity for 'Action' specifically.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirections. 'Mystery to be solved with clues and suspenseful moments' strongly points to 'Thriller'. 'Complex plot exploring characters' inner struggles and motivations' also leans heavily towards 'Thriller' or potentially a more character-driven 'Adventure', effectively steering players away from 'Action'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively clear. However, the misinformed clues, while not perfect, do offer some potential for confusion if a player overemphasizes character depth or mystery elements. The fake clues are very effective misdirections.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to 'Action'. The fake clues are very strong misdirections towards 'Thriller'. The misinformed clues are too general and don't create sufficient ambiguity for 'Action' within the context of the other choices.,15,15,100%,16.7
3,Movie,2,Mad Max: Fury Road,"Psycho, Mad Max: Fury Road, Indiana Jones",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using direct answer words. They highlight unique aspects like practical effects, post-apocalyptic aesthetic, strong female lead, minimal dialogue, desert wasteland setting, iconic vehicles, and relentless action. This provides strong, distinct angles pointing directly to the correct answer.",2,"The clues are too vague. While factually true for all options ('exciting, thrilling story', 'journey filled with obstacles', 'characters who face difficult circumstances'), they lack the specificity to create productive ambiguity. They don't strongly point to any specific incorrect answer over another, nor do they effectively distract from the correct one. The universal intersection is very broad.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Psycho' by mentioning a detective, killer, and motives. The second clue directly targets 'Indiana Jones' with an archeologist and a priceless artifact. Both are entirely unrelated to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and create strong, plausible diversions.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify if the player connects them. However, the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players to specific incorrect answers, which adds a layer of difficulty and requires careful consideration of all clues. The misinformed clues are too weak to significantly impact difficulty.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The informed clues are specific and point strongly to the correct answer, while the fake clues provide excellent misdirection to the incorrect choices.

4,Movie,1,Drama,"Drama, Romance, Comedy",5,"The clues for 'Drama' are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language that directly relates to the genre's characteristics without using the answer word or its synonyms. They cover emotional depth, character focus, conflict, and thematic exploration effectively.",2,"These clues are too vague. While 'relationship dynamics, conflict, and resolution' and 'relatable human experiences' can apply to Drama, they are also very broad and could plausibly describe Romance and Comedy to a significant degree. The ambiguity is present but not productive enough to be challenging.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They perfectly describe 'Comedy' with terms like 'lighthearted elements,' 'witty dialogue,' 'humorous situations,' 'amusement,' and 'laughter,' making them highly plausible for that incorrect choice while being completely irrelevant to 'Drama'.",,4,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong, pointing directly to 'Drama'. The 'Fake' clues are also highly effective misdirection towards 'Comedy'. The 'Misinformed' clues are the weakest link in terms of productive ambiguity, being overly general. The combination, however, presents a good challenge, especially with the strong fake clues.","The 'Informed' clues are excellent and specific to 'Drama'. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards 'Comedy'. The 'Misinformed' clues are too broad and do not create sufficient productive ambiguity, as they could easily apply to multiple incorrect options without much thought.

4,Movie,2,The Shawshank Redemption,"Titanic, The Shawshank Redemption, Groundhog Day",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and use descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or answer words. They cover key plot points, themes, and character dynamics without being overly generic.",1,"These clues are too specific to 'Titanic' and 'Groundhog Day' respectively. They fail the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'The narrative explores the complexities of human relationships and the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment' is true for all three films, but the second clue, 'The story focuses on a central relationship that is tested by external forces and personal challenges,' is much more applicable to 'Titanic' and 'Groundhog Day' than 'The Shawshank Redemption' (though arguably true, it's far less central). The goal is for *both* misinformed clues to be true for *all* options.",5,These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Titanic' and 'Groundhog Day' respectively. They use distinct plot elements of those films and are completely unrelated to 'The Shawshank Redemption'.,,4,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable for someone familiar with the film. The fake clues are also quite strong for the incorrect options. The misinformed clues, as written, are not effective at creating ambiguity. The difficulty stems from the strong informed clues potentially making it too easy if the player knows the film, but the misinformed clues need significant revision to add true ambiguity.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. However, the misinformed clues fail to meet the core requirement of being universally true for all answer choices, rendering them ineffective for creating productive ambiguity. They need to be rewritten to be genuinely vague and applicable to all three films.",15,15,100%,16.7
5,Movie,1,Horror,"Horror, Thriller, Sci-Fi",4,"The clues are specific and accurately describe the 'Horror' genre without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover various aspects like emotional response, themes, and common elements.",2,"These clues are too general. 'Features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' could apply to Thriller. 'Aims to evoke strong emotional responses, such as excitement, fear, or anticipation' is true for both Horror and Thriller. They do not create enough ambiguity as they lean towards Thriller without being equally applicable to Horror.",4,"The first fake clue strongly points to 'Sci-Fi' with 'complex plots, time travel, and advanced technology'. The second fake clue points to 'Thriller' with 'espionage, mystery, and complex plots involving government secrets'. Both are effective misdirections away from 'Horror'.",,3,"The informed clues are good, but the misinformed clues are not as effective in creating ambiguity between Horror and Thriller. The fake clues are strong misdirectors. This balance makes the game moderately challenging.",The informed clues are well-crafted. The misinformed clues need improvement to be more ambiguous and applicable to both Horror and Thriller. The fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards Sci-Fi and Thriller.,14,14,100%,16.4
5,Movie,2,The Shining,"Inception, The Shining, Alien",5,The clues are highly specific to 'The Shining' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They capture the unique elements of the film effectively.,3,The misinformed clues are factually true for all three options but are general enough to not be immediately dismissible. They require careful consideration to differentiate.,5,"The fake clues are perfectly crafted to strongly point to 'Inception' and 'Alien' respectively, effectively misdirecting away from 'The Shining'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, but the misinformed clues offer just enough shared truth to prevent it from being too easy.

The informed clues are precise and descriptive, the misinformed clues offer productive ambiguity, and the fake clues provide strong, targeted misdirection.",14,14,100%,16.4
6,Movie,1,Romance,"Romance, Drama, Comedy",5,"The clues are specific to the core themes of romance, such as 'human connection', 'emotional bond', 'pursuit of love', 'passionate relationships', 'courtship', 'affection', 'finding and maintaining love', and 'intimate relationships'. They effectively describe romance without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They cover different facets of the genre, providing distinct angles.",3,"The clues 'This genre commonly deals with stories that feature characters and their interactions, often including conflict.' and 'It involves narratives featuring people and their interactions, frequently addressing emotional experiences of life and love.' are indeed true for Romance, Drama, and Comedy. However, the second clue uses 'love' which might slightly lean towards Romance, potentially reducing its perfect ambiguity for all three. The ambiguity is productive but could be stronger by removing 'love'.",5,"The first fake clue ('This type of film is characterized by its humor and witty dialogue, often featuring comedic situations and characters.') strongly points to Comedy. The second fake clue ('The characters in this genre frequently encounter difficult situations, which they must overcome through perseverance.') strongly points to Drama. Both are effective misdirections and completely unrelated to Romance.",,3,The informed clues are strong and specific enough to guide a player towards Romance. The misinformed clues are ambiguous enough to cause some hesitation but not so vague as to be unhelpful. The fake clues provide clear misdirection to Comedy and Drama. This balance creates a moderately challenging game.,The set of clues effectively targets the answer 'Romance' with specific informed clues. The misinformed clues are generally good but could be slightly more universally applicable. The fake clues provide excellent misdirection to the other options. The difficulty is well-balanced.,14,14,100%,17.0
6,Movie,2,Pride and Prejudice,"The Notebook, Pride and Prejudice, When Harry Met Sally",5,The informed clues are excellent. They use descriptive language that directly points to 'Pride and Prejudice' without using forbidden words or synonyms. Clues like 'intricate social dynamics of the British upper class during the 19th century' and 'initial dislike that evolves into a deep connection through misunderstanding' are highly specific and accurate for the correct answer.,3,"These clues are sufficiently vague. 'The story revolves around the development of a relationship between two characters that blossoms over time' could apply to all three choices. 'The central narrative focuses on the emotional growth of the main characters and their journey through life' is also general enough to fit all options, creating productive ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. 'The story revolves around a couple's journey to find love in the midst of a war, facing many perilous circumstances' strongly points to 'The Notebook' and avoids 'Pride and Prejudice'. 'A story of two people falling in love while living in a city that never sleeps, with many exciting events' is a clear misdirection towards 'When Harry Met Sally'.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The informed clues are strong enough to guide a knowledgeable player towards the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide enough plausible distraction to make it challenging for someone less familiar with the options.","This is a well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are precise and informative, the misinformed clues create good ambiguity, and the fake clues are effective at misdirecting players to incorrect choices. The scoring reflects the quality of the clue generation based on the provided criteria.",14,14,100%,17.5
7,Movie,1,Thriller,"Thriller, Mystery, Action",5,"The clues for 'Thriller' are precise, using descriptive language that directly relates to the genre's core elements without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover suspense, danger, unease, twists, and atmosphere effectively.",2,"The clues provided for 'MISINFORMED' are too specific and lean towards 'Action' or general adventure rather than being truly ambiguous across all incorrect options. For example, 'designed to keep viewers engaged and excited' and 'overcome obstacles and come face-to-face with danger and challenges' could apply to 'Action' much more strongly than 'Mystery'. To be truly ambiguous, they would need to focus on shared, extremely general traits like 'involves characters' or 'has a narrative'.",5,"The 'FAKE' clues are excellent. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Action' with specific tropes like 'car chases, explosions, and fight scenes' and 'amazing strength and power,' effectively misdirecting away from 'Thriller' and 'Mystery'.",,3,"The 'INFORMED' clues are strong, and the 'FAKE' clues are very effective misdirection. The main weakness is the 'MISINFORMED' clues, which are too specific and not ambiguous enough. This prevents the puzzle from being optimally challenging.","The 'INFORMED' and 'FAKE' clues are well-crafted. The 'MISINFORMED' clues need to be significantly generalized to create the intended ambiguity across all incorrect choices. As they stand, they lean too heavily towards one specific incorrect answer ('Action').",15,15,100%,16.8
7,Movie,2,Inception,"Sherlock Holmes, Inception, James Bond",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using unique terminology and concepts directly tied to 'Inception' without directly naming it. They cover plot elements, thematic concerns, and visual aspects in a precise manner.",2,"These clues are too general. While factually true for 'Inception', they also apply broadly to many action or adventure narratives, making them not productively ambiguous for this specific set of choices. 'Dangerous mission in a foreign place' and 'facing difficult challenges and overcoming obstacles together as a team' could apply to James Bond significantly.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first strongly points to 'Sherlock Holmes' by mentioning detectives, murders, clues, and motives. The second is a classic description of 'James Bond' with secret agents, gadgets, and daring missions.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear if analyzed. However, the misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are strong misdirectors, creating a moderate difficulty level. The strength of the fake clues might push it slightly higher, but the directness of the informed clues balances it.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, offering precise and unique descriptors. The fake clues are also very effective in misdirecting towards the incorrect options.

8,Movie,1,Fantasy,"Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Adventure",5,"The clues are precise and descriptive, using strong paraphrases that directly point to 'Fantasy' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover various aspects like magic, mythical creatures, quests, and medieval settings, providing a clear picture of the genre.",2,"These clues are too vague and could apply to multiple genres, not just 'Fantasy' and the incorrect options. While they are factually true for 'Fantasy', they lack the necessary ambiguity to be truly misleading. For example, 'protagonists facing perilous trials' is true for almost all genres. The goal is for these clues to be true for *all* options, and these lean too heavily towards specific plot devices rather than universal genre traits.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player. The first clue strongly points to 'Adventure' by mentioning rescue missions and perilous journeys. The second clue is a perfect fit for 'Sci-Fi' with its mention of advanced technology and space travel, making them excellent deceptive choices.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific enough to lead to the correct answer, while the fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect to the incorrect choices. The misinformed clues are a bit weak in their ambiguity, which slightly lowers the overall difficulty from a perfect 3, but the balance between informed and fake is good.","The informed clues are excellent and accurately represent the target answer. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The misinformed clues could be improved by being more universally applicable to all genres to create better ambiguity, but the overall set is strong.",14,14,100%,16.2
8,Movie,2,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Pirates of the Caribbean",4,"Clues are descriptive and specific to the correct answer without using direct keywords. They highlight unique plot points, themes, and settings. There is good variety in the clues.",2,"The misinformed clues are too generic. While factually true for all options, they don't create enough productive ambiguity. 'Quest and a team' and 'perilous trials and a dangerous journey' are so broad they barely serve the purpose of misdirection.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. They directly and accurately describe the incorrect choices ('swashbuckling adventure with pirates' for Pirates of the Caribbean, and 'rebels fighting against a tyrannical empire' for Star Wars), providing strong misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to point to the correct answer for someone familiar with it. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting. The misinformed clues are a bit weak, which slightly lowers the overall challenge.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted.

9,Movie,1,Animation,"Animation, Family, Comedy",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Animation' without using the word itself. They cover various aspects like visual techniques, target audience, and creation methods. No answer contamination or synonym use.",4,"These clues are factually true for 'Animation', 'Family', and 'Comedy'. They focus on broad entertainment aspects like enjoyment, emotional resonance, and family appeal, creating good ambiguity for the incorrect options.",5,"These clues effectively point towards 'Family' and 'Comedy' by mentioning human actors, dramatic narratives, love, loss, and relationships, while completely avoiding any connection to 'Animation'.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong, making the answer discoverable. The misinformed clues provide decent ambiguity, and the fake clues are effective misdirection. This balance creates a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, accurately and specifically describing 'Animation'.

9,Movie,2,Toy Story,"Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Shrek",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, directly referencing key characters, plot points, and themes unique to 'Toy Story' without using any forbidden words. They effectively isolate the correct answer.",1,"These clues are too vague and could apply to almost any animated movie. They do not meet the critical requirement of being true for all incorrect answers and the correct answer. For example, 'lighthearted story for family viewing' is true for Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and Shrek. However, 'strong sense of friendship and the importance of helping others' is also true for all three. The clues are not productively ambiguous because they are too broad to be useful in a disinformer context.",5,The 'Fake' clues are highly effective. The first clue precisely describes 'Finding Nemo' with its underwater setting and clownfish protagonist. The second clue accurately describes 'Shrek' with its green ogre and princess narrative. Both are designed to strongly and plausibly point to incorrect answers while being completely unrelated to 'Toy Story'.,,2,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. The 'Fake' clues are also well-crafted to point away from the correct answer. The 'Misinformed' clues are too weak to add significant ambiguity, leaning towards making the puzzle easier than intended.","The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are excellent and well-aligned with their intended functions. The 'Misinformed' clues are too general and fail to create productive ambiguity, making them the weakest part of this set.

10,Movie,1,Documentary,"Documentary, Biography, Educational",5,"Clues are very specific to 'Documentary' and avoid any overlap with the other choices. They highlight the non-fictional, educational, and evidence-based nature of the genre.",1,These clues are too specific and would point directly to 'Biography' or potentially 'Educational' rather than being ambiguous for all incorrect choices. They fail the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers.,5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Biography' by focusing on fictional characters and dramatic storylines, which are antithetical to 'Documentary'.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are strong, and the 'Fake' clues are effective misdirection. The 'Misinformed' clues are weak and would need significant revision to create productive ambiguity. This makes the overall difficulty moderate.","The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are well-constructed. The 'Misinformed' clues need to be rewritten to be more ambiguous and applicable to all incorrect choices. Currently, they are too specific and would not serve their purpose.",14,14,100%,16.1
10,Movie,2,Won't You Be My Neighbor?,"Steve Jobs, Won't You Be My Neighbor?, Cosmos",5,"The clues are highly specific to Fred Rogers and 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?', effectively describing his work, philosophy, and impact without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They cover different facets of his legacy, from community and empathy to children's education and emotional development. The language is descriptive and evocative.",2,"These clues are too vague and could potentially apply to any biographical film about a public figure. While factually true for 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?', they are also true for 'Steve Jobs' (a public figure whose impact on the world is undeniable) and potentially even 'Cosmos' (though less directly biographical, it's about a public figure's exploration and impact). The ambiguity is present but not very productive as it doesn't strongly suggest any incorrect answer over another, nor does it offer a strong pull towards the correct answer beyond the most basic biographical aspect.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. The first clue ('tech innovator whose inventions revolutionized the world') perfectly targets 'Steve Jobs' without any overlap with 'Won't You Be My Neighbor?'.
