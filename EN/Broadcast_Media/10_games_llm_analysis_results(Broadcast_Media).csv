They are completely unrelated to Sci-Fi and effectively misdirect away from the correct answer.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer clear. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting. The misinformed clues are the weakest link, being too generic. This combination makes it challenging but not overwhelmingly so, as the strong informed clues can be overcome by the strong fake clues if the player isn't careful.","The informed clues are excellent, precisely defining Sci-Fi without any overlap.

The second clue is better, as all genres can evoke emotions. It creates some ambiguity but could be stronger.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first clue strongly and plausibly describes 'Adventure' with 'thrilling quest', 'daring escapades', and 'heroic protagonists'.

They are designed to mislead players directly to the wrong answers.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one focuses on the specific details. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create enough ambiguity to potentially confuse players, and the fake clues are highly deceptive.

The first and third clues strongly point to 'The Godfather' by mentioning crime families, loyalty, power, betrayal, mafia, violence, and familial bonds.
