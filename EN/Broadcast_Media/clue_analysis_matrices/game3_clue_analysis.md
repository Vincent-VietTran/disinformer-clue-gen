## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive of 'Action' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively capture the essence of the genre through its common elements like physical challenges, combat, and high-stakes narratives.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three genres (Action, Thriller, Adventure) as they all involve storytelling, visuals, and often conflict/resolution. They create genuine ambiguity by highlighting shared aspects of cinematic entertainment without pointing to any specific genre over another.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to 'Thriller,' the second to 'Adventure,' and the third to 'Thriller' or 'Action' (espionage). They are plausible descriptions of incorrect choices and completely avoid 'Action'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to 'Mad Max: Fury Road' without using direct keywords. They focus on visual storytelling, vehicle dominance, post-apocalyptic setting, strong female lead, practical effects, and the relentless chase narrative. The language is descriptive and evocative, perfectly aligning with the film's unique characteristics.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all options. 'Thrilling sequences, visually striking scenes, and a relentless pace' apply to action films like all three. 'Themes of survival, struggle, and the human spirit's resilience' are common in action/thriller genres. They create some ambiguity but could be slightly more specific to the shared essence of chase/survival narratives without distinguishing.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are expertly crafted to point directly to the incorrect choices. The first clue strongly describes 'John Wick' (avenging a dog). The second points to 'The Bourne Identity' (operative on the run, piecing together identity). The third describes a generic action scenario that could fit 'John Wick' or 'The Bourne Identity' but is far from 'Mad Max: Fury Road'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
