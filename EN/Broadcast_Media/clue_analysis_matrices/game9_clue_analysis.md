## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to the correct answer and use descriptive language that avoids answer contamination. They effectively highlight the unique aspects of a cooking show.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are true for all options (Talk Show, Game Show, Cooking Show) as they all are broadcasted on television with a host/presenter and are designed to entertain. The second clue is also true for all as they involve entertainment and competition (in varying degrees for talk shows). This creates genuine ambiguity as intended.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are designed to strongly point towards 'Talk Show' and 'Game Show' by mentioning interviews, discussions, current events, popular culture, contestants, questions, puzzles, and prizes, all of which are absent from the 'Cooking Show' description.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to MasterChef, using terms like 'home cooks', 'mystery box challenges', and 'pressure tests' which are distinctive features. They avoid answer contamination and focus on unique aspects of the show, effectively pointing to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three shows (Top Chef, MasterChef, Chopped) as they all feature judges, competition, and contestants demonstrating abilities. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on the common elements of competitive cooking shows without being overly specific, fulfilling the criteria for a good misinformed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are designed to strongly mislead towards other types of shows. 'Experts discuss performances and offer advice' could fit a talent show or a debate show. 'Trivia and ability to think on their feet' points towards game shows. 'Contestants' relationships and drama' suggests reality dating or social experiment shows. They are completely unrelated to the culinary competition genre of the correct answer and are believable for other show types.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
