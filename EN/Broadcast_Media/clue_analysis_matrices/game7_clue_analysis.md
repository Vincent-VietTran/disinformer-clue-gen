**Test Run 7 | Round 1: Broadcast Media**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are descriptive and focus on the core elements of reality shows. They avoid answer contamination and offer distinct angles. The score is 4 because some clues could be slightly more precise in their phrasing to avoid any potential overlap with other genres, though it's a minor point.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three choices (Reality Show, Dating Show, Talent Show). They describe a form of entertainment that involves participation, competition, and audience engagement. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on overarching aspects of televised competitions and entertainment formats. The score is 3 because while they are true for all, they are also quite generic and could be more subtly misleading.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to a Talent Show, the second to a Dating Show, and the third to a Talent Show again. They are plausible descriptions of the incorrect choices and completely avoid any description of the correct answer, 'Reality Show'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The difficulty is moderate to high. The informed clues are strong and specific to the correct answer. However, the misinformed clues are broad enough to be plausibly true for all options, and the fake clues are very convincing for the incorrect options, requiring careful analysis to distinguish.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues accurately describe 'Reality Show'. The misinformed clues are appropriately broad and true for all options, creating ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards the incorrect choices. The overall set provides a good challenge.

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the 'Physical: 100' answer, using descriptive language that strongly points to the physical challenges, endurance, and competition aspect. They avoid answer contamination and focus on distinct angles of the show's format.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options in a very broad sense (they all involve competition and challenges). However, they are not specific enough to create genuine ambiguity for 'Physical: 100' versus the others. They could be more precisely crafted to intersect the shared elements more effectively without being too obvious.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are excellent at misdirecting to the wrong choices. 'Competitors navigate through obstacle courses and face challenges to avoid being eliminated from the competition.' strongly suggests 'Wipeout.' 'Contestants are stranded on an island and must work together and use strategy to survive challenges.' perfectly describes 'Survivor.' 'Individuals compete to showcase their unique talents in front of a panel of judges and a live audience.' points clearly to a talent show, not represented in the choices but serves as a good misdirection example of the type of clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
