## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are precise and descriptive, using strong paraphrases that directly point to 'Fantasy' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover various aspects like magic, mythical creatures, quests, and medieval settings, providing a clear picture of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague and could apply to multiple genres, not just 'Fantasy' and the incorrect options. While they are factually true for 'Fantasy', they lack the necessary ambiguity to be truly misleading. For example, 'protagonists facing perilous trials' is true for almost all genres. The goal is for these clues to be true for *all* options, and these lean too heavily towards specific plot devices rather than universal genre traits.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player. The first clue strongly points to 'Adventure' by mentioning rescue missions and perilous journeys. The second clue is a perfect fit for 'Sci-Fi' with its mention of advanced technology and space travel, making them excellent deceptive choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong and specific enough to lead to the correct answer, while the fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect to the incorrect choices. The misinformed clues are a bit weak in their ambiguity, which slightly lowers the overall difficulty from a perfect 3, but the balance between informed and fake is good.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and accurately represent the target answer. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The misinformed clues could be improved by being more universally applicable to all genres to create better ambiguity, but the overall set is strong.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5

Clues are descriptive and specific to the correct answer without using direct keywords. They highlight unique plot points, themes, and settings. There is good variety in the clues.

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
