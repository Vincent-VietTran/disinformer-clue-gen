## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are specific and accurately describe the 'Horror' genre without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover various aspects like emotional response, themes, and common elements.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too general. 'Features suspense, thrills, and elements of the unknown' could apply to Thriller. 'Aims to evoke strong emotional responses, such as excitement, fear, or anticipation' is true for both Horror and Thriller. They do not create enough ambiguity as they lean towards Thriller without being equally applicable to Horror.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The first fake clue strongly points to 'Sci-Fi' with 'complex plots, time travel, and advanced technology'. The second fake clue points to 'Thriller' with 'espionage, mystery, and complex plots involving government secrets'. Both are effective misdirections away from 'Horror'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
