## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to the correct answer and avoid any overlap with the incorrect choices. They use descriptive language and avoid direct synonyms or variations of the answer word.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all options as they are all musical genres. They are vague enough to apply broadly but not so vague as to be meaningless. They create genuine ambiguity without pointing towards any specific answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards 'Heavy metal' by highlighting its characteristic fast tempo, heavy guitar riffs, aggressive vocals, complex arrangements, and themes of fantasy and mythology, while completely avoiding any elements of 'Reggae'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear to those familiar with music genres. The fake clues effectively misdirect towards a specific wrong answer. The misinformed clues are generic enough to provide some ambiguity but not enough to significantly hinder identification of the correct answer given the strong informed clues.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the correct answer. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting towards 'Heavy metal'. The misinformed clues, while factually correct for all options, are not strong enough to create significant confusion due to the strength of the other clue types.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'One Love' without using any forbidden words. They focus on themes of unity, peace, togetherness, hope, understanding, universal love, acceptance, social justice, spiritual consciousness, and communal/inclusive feeling. The musical descriptions like 'gentle rhythm', 'simple structure', 'distinctive bassline', 'memorable melody', and 'call-and-response vocal style' also align perfectly. The score is high because these clues are precise and effectively isolate the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three songs. All three are songs with powerful vocals and musical arrangements. All three are recognized for memorable lyrics that tell a story or express feelings. The ambiguity is genuine and productive, making it difficult to distinguish based on these clues alone.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The 'Fake' clues are designed to strongly point to 'Hotel California' (introspective lyrics, heartbreak, complex musicality, narrative of personal struggle/triumph with guitars) and 'Rude' (themes of freedom/rebellion, raw/energetic vocals). They are plausible enough to misdirect players away from 'One Love' while avoiding any direct overlap with its specific themes or musical characteristics.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer discoverable if analyzed carefully. However, the 'Misinformed' clues are well-crafted to create genuine ambiguity, and the 'Fake' clues provide plausible misdirection to incorrect answers. This balance creates a moderate difficulty level.

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing precise and descriptive hints that strongly point to 'One Love'. The misinformed clues are well-balanced, offering true but non-discriminatory statements for all options, fostering ambiguity. The fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards the incorrect choices. The overall structure and quality of clues are good for a disinformer game.
