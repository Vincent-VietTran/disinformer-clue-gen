## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are precise, descriptive, and avoid any answer words, variations, or synonyms. They strongly point to 'Rock' by highlighting its energetic sound, rebellious themes, instrumental focus (electric guitars, drums), origins in blues/country, and cultural impact.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all options (Rock, Pop, Classic) as they all are forms of artistic expression using sound and rhythm. They create genuine ambiguity by being broad enough to apply to any musical genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Pop' and 'Classic'. The first clue points strongly to Pop with 'catchy hooks' and 'easy to remember lyrics'. The third clue directly describes 'Classic' with 'full orchestra' and 'classic instruments'. Neither clue relates to 'Rock'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and accurately describe 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without using any of the forbidden words or their direct synonyms. They highlight its unique structure, musical elements, vocal arrangements, length, lyrical interpretation, and iconic music video, all of which are distinctive to the song.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three songs. 'Soaring vocals, passionate delivery, and memorable melodies' can apply to all three. 'Personal experiences that resonate' is also broad enough to fit the narrative or perceived themes of each. They create a decent level of ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are designed to misdirect. The first clue about 'affection, loss, and enduring strength' could plausibly point to 'Hotel California' or even 'Stairway to Heaven' depending on interpretation. The second about 'hope, faith, and life's journey' also broadly fits the other two. The third about 'classic rock anthem, soaring guitar solos, and powerful vocals' is a strong descriptor for Led Zeppelin and Eagles, and less so for Queen's operatic sections, thus effectively directing away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
