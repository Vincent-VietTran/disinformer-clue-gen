## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific and descriptive, avoiding any mention of the answer word or its synonyms. They accurately and precisely point to the 'Medical' field without ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues successfully create ambiguity by focusing on shared aspects of innovation, problem-solving, and improvement of daily life, which can apply to Medical, Communication, and Transportation. They are factually true for all options and avoid distinguishing details.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are excellent examples of misdirection. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Communication' and 'Transportation' while being completely unrelated to 'Medical', effectively steering the player away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options. 'Product of scientific research used to improve health and protect against diseases' applies to all. 'Instrumental in saving lives and improving well-being' also applies broadly. They create genuine ambiguity by highlighting shared benefits.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first clue ('electromagnetic radiation') strongly points to X-ray. The second clue ('powerful and preventative properties, fight infectious diseases') strongly points to Penicillin. The third clue ('kill bacteria and prevent growth of infections') also strongly points to Penicillin. These are highly effective misdirections to the incorrect choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
