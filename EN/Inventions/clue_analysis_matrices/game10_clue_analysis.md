# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 10 | Round 1: Inventions**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Instrument' without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like sound production, artistic use, skill requirement, and component mechanisms, providing distinct angles.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While true for 'Instrument', they are also true for 'Tool' and 'Device' in a very general sense, but lack the specific overlap needed to be truly misleading. They fail the critical requirement of being equally true for all incorrect answers in a way that creates confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Tool' and 'Device' respectively. The first clue strongly points to 'Tool' by mentioning 'physical tasks' and 'mechanical advantage', while the second points to 'Device' with 'precise measurements and calculations'. They completely avoid the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards the correct answer, but the misinformed clues are too weak to cause significant confusion. The fake clues are effective misdirection. This balance makes it moderately difficult, requiring players to discern the specificity of the informed clues while avoiding the misdirection of the fake ones.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting. The misinformed clues need significant improvement to be truly ambiguous and meet the criteria of being equally true for all incorrect answers.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5
