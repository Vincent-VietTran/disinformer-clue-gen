None of these clues relate to the core concept of a 'Team Sport' where multiple individuals form a collective unit against another.,,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer clear.

The first clue strongly points to basketball, the second to American football, and the third also to American football, while completely avoiding any characteristics of soccer.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the misinformed clues offer plausible but non-distinguishing information.

They use terms like 'orchestrated movements between multiple players', 'collaboration, communication, and strategic teamwork', and 'outmaneuver opponents working together', which are antithetical to 'Individual Sport' and strongly suggestive of team-based or partner-based activities. They completely avoid any connection to the correct answer.",,4,"The strong fake clues combined with highly specific informed clues create a challenging game. The misinformed clues are not so weak as to be immediately dismissible, and the fake clues are very persuasive. The informed clues are excellent but require careful reading to ensure no overlap with the other categories. The difficulty comes from discerning the precise boundaries between the categories, especially between the fake and misinformed, and ensuring the informed clues are truly unique to the answer.","The informed clues are excellent, meeting all criteria for specificity and avoiding forbidden terms. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting away from the correct answer and towards team or dual sports.

These are effective at misdirecting away from 'Dual Sport'.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the misinformed clues offer plausible but ultimately unhelpful commonalities. The fake clues are well-crafted to strongly suggest the incorrect options.
