## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.6 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Individual Sport' and avoid any overlap with 'Team Sport' or 'Dual Sport'. They focus on self-reliance, personal effort, and individual achievement, which are defining characteristics of the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. 'Athletes showcase physical and mental prowess while striving to reach the pinnacle of athletic competition' is true for all sports. 'This activity involves a contest or game where competitors strive to achieve a common objective or goal' is also true for all sports. They fail the crucial requirement of being true for all incorrect answers while being ambiguous.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. They perfectly describe 'Team Sport' by emphasizing 'players working together', 'coordinating actions', 'collective effort', and 'team's overall strategy and success', making them highly plausible for an incorrect choice.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' and 'Fake' clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The 'Misinformed' clues need significant revision to meet the criteria of productive ambiguity and shared truth across all options.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately detailing the core mechanics and elements of boxing without using any forbidden terms. They clearly differentiate boxing from the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

The provided 'misinformed' clues are too general and do not effectively create ambiguity. They are factually true for boxing, but also broadly true for MMA and wrestling, which is the goal. However, they lack nuance and don't offer much productive confusion. They are too close to being 'informed' by their limited scope.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. They directly describe elements common in MMA and wrestling (grappling, submissions, striking and grappling combinations) and are completely unrelated to boxing, strongly steering players towards the incorrect answers.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'informed' clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively clear to someone familiar with combat sports. The 'fake' clues are very effective at misdirecting, but the overall balance leans towards a moderate difficulty, especially if the player can identify the specific nuances of the informed clues.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'informed' and 'fake' clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The 'misinformed' clues could be improved to offer more nuanced ambiguity, but their current state doesn't significantly detract from the game's design. The combination of specific informed clues and highly deceptive fake clues creates a good challenge.
