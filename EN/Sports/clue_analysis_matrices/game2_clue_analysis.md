# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 2 | Round 1: Sports**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.8 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to 'Individual Sport' without using forbidden terms. They effectively describe solo effort, personal responsibility, and internal drive, directly contrasting with team or dual dynamics. No answer contamination or synonyms are present.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Team, Individual, Dual sports involve physical activity, strategy, and pursuit of victory). They create some ambiguity by focusing on general aspects of competitive activities. However, they don't offer deep, thematic ambiguity that would be truly misleading. They are too generic to strongly pull towards a wrong answer but fulfill the intersection requirement.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Team Sport' or 'Dual Sport'. They use terms like 'orchestrated movements between multiple players', 'collaboration, communication, and strategic teamwork', and 'outmaneuver opponents working together', which are antithetical to 'Individual Sport' and strongly suggestive of team-based or partner-based activities. They completely avoid any connection to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The strong fake clues combined with highly specific informed clues create a challenging game. The misinformed clues are not so weak as to be immediately dismissible, and the fake clues are very persuasive. The informed clues are excellent but require careful reading to ensure no overlap with the other categories. The difficulty comes from discerning the precise boundaries between the categories, especially between the fake and misinformed, and ensuring the informed clues are truly unique to the answer.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues
- Missing specificity in clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, meeting all criteria for specificity and avoiding forbidden terms. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting away from the correct answer and towards team or dual sports. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options and create some, albeit limited, ambiguity. The overall difficulty is high due to the strength of the fake clues and the precise nature of the informed clues.
