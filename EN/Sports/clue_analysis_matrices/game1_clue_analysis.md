## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of 'Team Sport' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively highlight collective effort, communication, cooperation, and shared objectives. They avoid any hint of individual or dual competition.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three answer choices (Team Sport, Individual Sport, Dual Sport). They describe general characteristics of competitive activities: physical exertion, strategic thinking, skill, practice, and competition. They create ambiguity by being applicable to any sport, thus not helping to eliminate any option.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are expertly crafted to misdirect. The first and third clues strongly point to 'Individual Sport' by emphasizing personal effort and records. The second clue points to 'Dual Sport' by mentioning two people working together. None of these clues relate to the core concept of a 'Team Sport' where multiple individuals form a collective unit against another.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

The informed clues are excellent, precisely defining 'Team Sport' without overlap. The misinformed clues meet the criteria for being true for all options and creating ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards 'Individual Sport' and 'Dual Sport'.
