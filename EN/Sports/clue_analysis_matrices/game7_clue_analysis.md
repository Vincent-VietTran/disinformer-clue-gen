## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Combat sports' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover various aspects like physical prowess, strategy, intensity, rules, and history uniquely associated with combat sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too specific to 'Ball games' or 'Esports'. For instance, 'follow a strict set of rules' is true for all, but 'high level of physical fitness' is less applicable to Esports. They do not create productive ambiguity as they lean too much towards specific types of sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue strongly points towards 'Esports' or 'Ball games' by mentioning 'Teamwork and coordination' and 'common goal'. The second clue is a clear misdirection towards 'Ball games' by mentioning 'guiding a ball into a designated area' and 'exceeding the competitor's final score'. Neither clue relates to 'Combat sports'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
