## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They effectively highlight the physical and mental aspects of combat sports. Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other, but overall good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three categories (Combat sports, Ball games, Esports) as they all involve competition, skill, strategy, and mental focus. They create ambiguity by focusing on universal aspects of competitive activities, making it difficult to immediately distinguish between them without considering the informed clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues strongly point towards 'Ball games' by mentioning spherical objects, nets, goals, and hitting balls across fields. They are completely unrelated to 'Combat sports' and 'Esports', effectively misdirecting players away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

The fake clues are highly deceptive for ball games. This balance creates a moderate challenge.

- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

1. Minor length adjustments

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues accurately describe combat sports without using forbidden words. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to apply to all categories, fostering ambiguity. The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting towards ball games. The difficulty level is appropriate.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They effectively highlight the unique aspects of Taekwondo, such as the emphasis on dynamic kicking, its Korean origin, and the specific competition elements. Some clues could be slightly more abstract to avoid overlap with general martial arts concepts, but overall good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three martial arts (Karate, Judo, Taekwondo) in a very general sense. They describe the fundamental nature of competitive combat sports and the dedication of athletes. This creates genuine ambiguity as all three options fit this description. The clues are not too specific to any one option and don't contain unique details.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The first fake clue strongly points to Judo ('throw opponents to the ground using grips, throws, and grappling techniques'). The second fake clue could point to Karate or Taekwondo ('striking opponents with fists, elbows, knees, and feet'). The third fake clue could point to Judo or Karate ('subdue the opponent by applying joint locks, chokeholds, or pins'). They are plausible for incorrect options and avoid direct mention of Taekwondo's dominant kicking focus.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues effectively describe Taekwondo without using its name or direct synonyms. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to apply to all options, creating good ambiguity. The fake clues are plausibly misleading towards Karate and Judo. The difficulty level seems appropriate.
