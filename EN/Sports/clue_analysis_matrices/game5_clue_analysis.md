## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are excellent. They precisely describe the cognitive and strategic aspects of 'Mind Sports' without using any forbidden words. They effectively differentiate from physical or motor sports.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three categories (Physical sports, Mind sports, Motor sports) as they all involve competition, skill, strategy, and rules. They create ambiguity by focusing on the universal aspects of competitive activities, making it challenging to immediately distinguish between them without the informed clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to 'Physical sports' by mentioning endurance, strength, and agility. The second clue clearly describes 'Motor sports' with vehicles, racing, and tracks. They are plausible descriptions of the incorrect options and avoid any hint of 'Mind Sports'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality

**Overall Notes:**  
A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are precise and effective. The misinformed clues provide good, albeit basic, ambiguity. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards the incorrect categories.

## 1. Length Compliance

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, clearly pointing to 'Chess' without using any forbidden terms. They highlight key mechanics like piece movement, strategic planning, the checkered board, and the objective of capturing the monarch. There is no answer contamination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three choices (Chess, Go, Poker). They focus on abstract concepts like strategy, skill, cognitive abilities, and anticipating opponents. This creates a genuine ambiguity as all three games require these elements. They avoid specific mechanics unique to any one game.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue strongly suggests 'Go' by mentioning colored stones, surrounding, and territory. The second clue perfectly describes 'Poker' with cards, values, suits, and betting. The third clue accurately describes 'Gomoku' (a variant of Go) or potentially Tic-Tac-Toe, but is completely unrelated to Chess, Go, or Poker in the context of the provided choices, making it a plausible misdirection for a different game if it were in the choices, but here it's just completely off-target for the given choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong enough to make 'Chess' the clear answer for someone familiar with the game. The misinformed clues provide a layer of plausible distraction, but the specificity of the informed clues should overcome this for most players. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect if they were targeting one of the incorrect answers, but their current form doesn't strongly point to Go or Poker over the other.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, precisely describing Chess. The misinformed clues offer good abstract commonalities. The fake clues are well-written but don't target the specific incorrect choices effectively within the provided set, though they are clearly distinct from the correct answer.
