## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language to define 'Ball games' without using any forbidden words. They effectively highlight key characteristics such as the use of a spherical object, teamwork, strategy, scoring, and global prevalence. The clues strongly point to 'Ball games' while effectively excluding the other options.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three options. Combat sports, Ball games, and Esports all involve competition, physical or mental exertion, and are enjoyed by many worldwide. They create genuine ambiguity as they don't point to any single category definitively, fulfilling the criteria for a good misinformed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent examples of fake clues. The first and third clues strongly and plausibly describe 'Combat sports' by focusing on physical altercations, strength, technique, and striking/grappling. The second clue is perfectly crafted to describe 'Esports' by mentioning competitive video gaming, virtual environments, strategy, skill, and reflexes. None of these clues relate to 'Ball games', ensuring strong misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
