1,Books,1,Fantasy,"Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Adventure",5,"The clues are highly specific to the 'Fantasy' genre, using keywords and concepts directly associated with it, such as 'magic,' 'mythical creatures,' 'imaginative worlds,' 'quests,' 'battles against evil,' and 'perilous journeys.' They effectively describe the core elements of fantasy without using the answer word itself. The clues are precise and do not overlap with the other choices.",3,"These clues are true for all three genres (Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Adventure) to some extent. They describe the general nature of storytelling ('designed to tell a story,' 'captivate the attention') and the common use of imaginative elements ('imaginative settings and characters'). This creates ambiguity as all genres can employ these aspects, making it difficult to definitively choose one based solely on these clues.",4,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Sci-Fi' and potentially 'Adventure.' Phrases like 'technologically advanced future,' 'space exploration,' 'alien life,' and 'advanced technology' strongly point to Sci-Fi. 'Exploration,' 'survival,' and 'treasures within unfamiliar and distant settings' could apply to both Sci-Fi and Adventure, effectively steering the player away from Fantasy.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific to Fantasy, making it relatively easy to identify. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create genuine ambiguity across all three options, and the fake clues are quite convincing for Sci-Fi and Adventure. This balance makes for a moderately challenging game.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely target 'Fantasy'. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by highlighting shared storytelling elements across all genres. The fake clues are strong misdirections, particularly towards 'Sci-Fi' and 'Adventure'.

They effectively highlight unique plot points, themes, and settings of the correct answer.",3,"The two misinformed clues are factually true for all three choices: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', 'Dune', and 'The Hobbit'. They focus on general narrative elements like 'growth and self-discovery' and 'unique environments with intricate details'. This creates genuine ambiguity as these descriptions could plausibly apply to a fantasy or adventure story.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue strongly points to 'Dune' ('desert planet', 'survival', 'environmentalism'). The second clue clearly targets 'The Hobbit' ('young hobbit', 'perilous quest', 'destroy a powerful ring'). The third clue, while slightly less specific, also aligns well with the war/resource control themes often associated with 'Dune'. They are unrelated to the correct answer and designed to mislead.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable to someone familiar with it. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to create ambiguity, and the fake clues are effective misdirections. This balance creates a moderate difficulty level.","This is a well-constructed set of clues for the disinformer game.

No answer contamination.",3,"These clues are true for all three genres (Mystery, Thriller, Crime) as they all aim to engage the audience and tell a compelling story. They create some ambiguity but are not overly specific. The connection to the core of storytelling is present in all.",5,"These clues are highly specific to 'Thriller' and 'Crime' (action, high-stakes, legal system, police work, violence, criminal activity) and completely miss the core of 'Mystery'. They offer strong misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, and the fake clues are very specific to incorrect options, creating a good level of challenge. The misinformed clues are adequately ambiguous.",Excellent set of clues. Informed clues are precise and point directly to the answer. Fake clues offer strong misdirection to incorrect choices.

2,Books,2,The Da Vinci Code,"Gone Girl, The Da Vinci Code, Sherlock Holmes",4,"The clues are specific and descriptive, directly pointing to the correct answer without using answer words or synonyms. They effectively highlight unique plot elements, themes, and settings of 'The Da Vinci Code'.",3,"These clues are true for all options as they describe general thriller/mystery elements like complex characters, plot twists, discovery, and the pursuit of truth. They create genuine ambiguity but are not overly specific.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards 'Gone Girl' or 'Sherlock Holmes' by focusing on disappearance, investigation, deception, and hidden motives, which are prominent in those incorrect choices and absent in the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to lead to the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide plausible distractions, creating a balanced challenge.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to the correct answer.

3,Books,1,Romance,"Romance, Drama, Historical",5,"The clues are highly specific to the core elements of romance, using descriptive language that directly points to the answer without using the word itself or close synonyms. They effectively highlight the centrality of love stories, emotional journeys, and relationship development.",3,"These clues are true for all genres of storytelling (Romance, Drama, Historical) as they all involve telling stories, capturing attention, and artistic expression. However, they are very generic and don't create strong ambiguity because they lack any specific thematic connection that would make one lean towards Drama or Historical over Romance. They are factually true for all but don't actively mislead towards the wrong choices.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to Historical with its mention of 'historical events and societal issues.' The second clue, with 'social injustice, political intrigue, and personal growth,' leans heavily towards Drama. The third clue, 'intense character studies, exploring themes of human nature and moral dilemmas,' also strongly suggests Drama or potentially Historical, effectively steering the player away from Romance.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making it relatively easy to identify Romance. The fake clues are also quite effective at misdirecting towards Drama or Historical. The misinformed clues are too generic to be truly effective in creating ambiguity, thus balancing the difficulty.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, providing clear and specific pointers to 'Romance.'

These precisely pinpoint the narrative arc and thematic elements of 'The Notebook' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively isolate the correct answer.",3,"These clues are true for all three choices. 'The story is a narrative of a long lasting relationship, with a strong focus on the characters' journey' applies to all three.

They create a degree of ambiguity but don't necessarily lead to confusion as they are quite general.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Outlander.' The first clue ('social class and prejudice,' 'protagonist challenges established norms') strongly points to 'Pride and Prejudice.' The second ('strong female character,' 'navigates societal expectations,' 'finds her own voice') could apply to 'Pride and Prejudice' or 'Outlander.' The third ('finding love amidst societal pressures and family disapproval in the countryside') is very strong for 'Pride and Prejudice' and somewhat for 'Outlander.' None of these clues could plausibly describe 'The Notebook.'",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear if one is familiar with the source material. However, the misinformed clues are general enough to create some initial ambiguity, and the fake clues are very deceptive, requiring careful discernment to avoid being misled. This combination makes it moderately difficult.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely identify the correct answer. The misinformed clues are factually true for all options and create a reasonable level of ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards the incorrect options, particularly 'Pride and Prejudice,' and are completely unrelated to the correct answer. The overall structure creates a challenging but fair game.",15,15,100%,17.3
4,Books,1,Sci-Fi,"Sci-Fi, Dystopian, Fantasy",5,"The clues are highly specific to Sci-Fi, using terms like 'possible futures', 'technology's impact', 'space travel, robots', 'scientific advancements', 'artificial intelligence', 'extraterrestrial life', and 'advanced technologies'. These are all core elements that distinctly point to Sci-Fi without being overly technical or naming specific works. They successfully describe the essence of the genre.",4,"These clues are excellent at creating ambiguity. 'Entertain and engage readers through imagined worlds and situations' and 'deal with a variety of themes, including good versus evil, love, and self-discovery' are true for all three genres (Sci-Fi, Dystopian, Fantasy). They don't point to any single option specifically, making them genuinely misleading.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first and third clues ('epic battles between good and evil, with magic and mythical creatures', 'swords, sorcery, and medieval settings') are perfect descriptors for Fantasy, and the second clue ('struggles of characters against oppressive governments and societal structures') is a strong descriptor for Dystopian. They completely avoid any connection to Sci-Fi.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear to those familiar with the genres. However, the misinformed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, creating significant ambiguity that could easily lead someone to the wrong answer if they aren't paying close attention to the nuances of the informed clues.

This balance of strong informed and misleading misinformed/fake clues makes the game challenging but fair.","The informed clues are precise and strongly indicative of Sci-Fi. The misinformed clues are masterful in their ability to apply to all three options, creating genuine confusion. The fake clues are highly effective at steering players towards Fantasy and Dystopian.

4,Books,2,1984,"Brave New World, 1984, Foundation",5,"The clues are highly specific and use precise descriptive language that directly points to '1984' without using any forbidden words. They capture the essence of surveillance, thought control, totalitarianism, and the struggle against oppressive systems.",3,"These clues are true for all options, as they all explore themes of social control and the consequences of political power. However, the ambiguity is moderate; 'social control' and 'authoritarian regimes' might lean slightly more towards '1984' and 'Brave New World' than 'Foundation,' but it's a reasonable intersection for misdirection.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to 'Brave New World,' the second to 'Foundation,' and the third to a generic fantasy quest. None of them are related to '1984.'",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one is familiar with the books.

They create ambiguity because they don't offer any distinguishing details that would help eliminate any of the choices, thus making the player consider all options based on these general statements.",5,"These clues are designed to strongly mislead. The first and third clues ('The story centers on a single individual's life...' and 'A detailed account of an individual's life...') are perfect misdirections for 'Biography.'
