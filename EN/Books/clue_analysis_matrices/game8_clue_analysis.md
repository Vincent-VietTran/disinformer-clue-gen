| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.8 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are quite specific to 'Biography' and effectively describe its core elements without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They focus on the external perspective, research, and historical context, which are key differentiators from 'Memoir' and 'Autobiography'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three options (Biography, Memoir, Autobiography) as they all involve human experiences, identity, and growth, and use narrative to communicate. They create ambiguity by focusing on universal aspects of life writing. They don't point to any specific answer over another.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly deceptive. They perfectly describe 'Autobiography' and 'Memoir' by emphasizing the first-person, personal viewpoint, individual experiences, and author's feelings. They strongly lead away from 'Biography' which is typically written by someone else.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are specific enough to strongly point to Biography, but the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create plausible confusion with the other two options. The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting to Memoir/Autobiography, making it challenging to distinguish.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are strong and specific to Biography. The misinformed clues successfully identify common ground between all three genres. The fake clues are particularly effective at misdirecting towards Autobiography/Memoir, making the overall puzzle challenging.
