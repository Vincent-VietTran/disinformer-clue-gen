## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are very specific and point directly to the correct answer without using any answer words or synonyms. They focus on the emotional impact, thematic elements, and narrative techniques characteristic of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three genres (Horror, Supernatural, Thriller) as they all can involve suspense, tension, and emotional engagement. They create ambiguity by highlighting shared characteristics without offering distinguishing details.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to Fantasy, the second to Crime/Mystery, and the third to Superhero/Action, none of which are related to Horror, Supernatural, or Thriller.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise paraphrases that directly point to 'It' without using any forbidden words. They capture the essence of the story's plot, themes, and antagonist's nature.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options to a certain extent: 'terrifying creature that causes fear and is a source of horror' applies to Dracula and It, and the supernatural threat in The Shining. 'Group of people facing a major threat, working together' applies to the Losers' Club in It and the protagonists in Dracula and The Shining. They create some ambiguity but could be more precisely crafted to maximize confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5

These clues are very effective at misdirecting players. The first clue strongly points to Dracula, the second to The Shining, and the third could also be interpreted as The Shining or a more general supernatural horror. They are plausible and avoid any overlap with 'It'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
