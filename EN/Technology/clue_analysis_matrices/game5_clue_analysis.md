## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively narrowing down the options to 'Smartphone' without using any direct or synonymous terms. They highlight key functionalities and societal impact.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet) as they all facilitate communication and data processing. However, they are quite generic and don't create strong ambiguity because the 'Informed' clues are so much more specific. They rely on a very broad intersection of functionality.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are well-crafted to strongly point to 'Laptop' and 'Tablet' respectively, using their common characteristics and primary uses. They effectively distract from the correct answer by focusing on distinct features of the incorrect options.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)
