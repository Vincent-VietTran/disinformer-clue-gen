✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues effectively target 'Cryptocurrency' and 'Banking App' respectively. They use specific terminology that strongly suggests those options and avoids any overlap with 'Payment System'.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are highly descriptive and precisely point to PayPal without using its name or direct synonyms. They focus on its core functionalities and impact on e-commerce. The language is varied, touching on its origins, security, user experience, and global reach.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three options (PayPal, Binance, Apple Pay) as they all facilitate money transfers and online transactions. However, they are slightly too specific to be perfectly ambiguous. For example, 'transfer of money between individuals and businesses easily' applies strongly to all. 'Send and receive payments' is also common. The ambiguity is present but could be stronger by being more abstract.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues are effective. The first two strongly point towards Binance by mentioning 'cryptocurrency trading' and 'digital assets'. The third clue, 'mobile devices,' points strongly towards Apple Pay, creating plausible misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
