They cover various aspects like technology, convenience, flexibility, and the impact on urban mobility, all while strictly adhering to the negative constraints.

✅ Strengths:

- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

They create ambiguity by being broad enough to encompass all choices, fulfilling the intersection requirement.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5

The third clearly describes a 'Navigation App' with GPS and traffic. They are plausible and avoid any hint of 'Ride-Sharing'.
