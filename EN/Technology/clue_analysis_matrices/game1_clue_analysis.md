**Test Run 1 | Round 1: Technology**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.3 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively isolating the concept of social media. They avoid using any direct or synonymous terms related to the answer choices and focus on the functional and user-experience aspects of social platforms. The use of terms like 'algorithms to customize content feeds' and 'building communities' are particularly strong indicators.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three choices (Social Media, Search Engine, E-commerce) as they all facilitate the sharing of information, connection, and communication on a global scale. They create a moderate level of ambiguity by focusing on these broad, overlapping functions. However, they could be slightly more abstract to increase the challenge.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues are well-crafted to strongly point towards 'Search Engine' and 'E-commerce' respectively, while being entirely unrelated to 'Social Media'. The descriptions are precise for those incorrect options, making them highly effective misdirections.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively clear. However, the misinformed clues provide just enough overlap to require careful consideration, and the fake clues are good misdirections. This combination creates a balanced difficulty.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer without contamination. The misinformed clues are functional but could be slightly more abstract for greater ambiguity. The fake clues are strong and effectively misdirect to the incorrect options.

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to Instagram, using descriptive paraphrases that avoid answer words. They effectively highlight visual content, stories/reels, aesthetics, influencers, photo editing, and the ownership by a larger company without naming it. They do not overlap with the other choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too generic and could apply to many social media platforms. 'A social networking service where people can share content, communicate, and interact with others online' and 'A platform that allows users to create and share various forms of media, connecting with a global audience' are true for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, but they don't create genuine ambiguity because they are so broad they don't truly distinguish any specific platform. They don't effectively misdirect.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue points strongly to Facebook ('news feed', 'friends and family'). The second fake clue strongly points to TikTok ('short videos', 'creative expression'). The third fake clue points to a platform like Reddit or a blog, not any of the choices. These are effective misdirections away from Instagram.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Instagram. The misinformed clues are too vague to be effective. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect to Facebook and TikTok.
