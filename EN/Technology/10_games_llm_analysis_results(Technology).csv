They effectively highlight visual content, stories/reels, aesthetics, influencers, photo editing, and the ownership by a larger company without naming it. They do not overlap with the other choices.",2,"These clues are too generic and could apply to many social media platforms. 'A social networking service where people can share content, communicate, and interact with others online' and 'A platform that allows users to create and share various forms of media, connecting with a global audience' are true for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, but they don't create genuine ambiguity because they are so broad they don't truly distinguish any specific platform. They don't effectively misdirect.",5,"The first fake clue points strongly to Facebook ('news feed', 'friends and family'). The second fake clue strongly points to TikTok ('short videos', 'creative expression'). The third fake clue points to a platform like Reddit or a blog, not any of the choices.
