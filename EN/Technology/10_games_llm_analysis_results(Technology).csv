1,Technology,1,Social Media,"Social Media, Search Engine, E-commerce",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language that clearly points to 'Social Media' without using any forbidden terms. They cover various aspects like user-generated content, community building, and real-time interaction.",1,"These clues are too general and do not meet the critical requirement of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers. 'Digital platform used by people worldwide for communication and interaction purposes' could also describe a search engine or e-commerce in a very broad sense, but the second clue is even weaker. They lack the productive ambiguity needed.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue ('primary portal for accessing information, research, and online resources') strongly points to 'Search Engine', and the second clue ('online marketplace allows individuals and businesses to buy and sell goods and services') perfectly describes 'E-commerce'. They are completely unrelated to 'Social Media'.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are strong enough to guide a player towards the correct answer, while the 'Fake' clues provide substantial misdirection towards the incorrect options. The 'Misinformed' clues are weak, which is a negative, but the overall balance allows for a moderate challenge.","The 'Informed' clues are excellent. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting to 'Search Engine' and 'E-commerce'. The 'Misinformed' clues are the weakest part of the set, as they are too vague and do not fulfill the requirement of being true for all incorrect options, thus not creating productive ambiguity. However, the strength of the other clue types balances this out for a moderate difficulty.",14,14,100%,16.4
1,Technology,2,Instagram,"Facebook, Instagram, TikTok",5,"The clues are highly specific to Instagram without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like visual content, filters, ephemeral stories, connections, business use, hashtags, direct messaging, advertising, and influencer marketing.",1,"The provided 'misinformed' clues are not ambiguous enough. They are factually true for Instagram but also too specific, making them lean towards being 'informed' or even 'fake' if they don't apply equally to Facebook and TikTok. For example, 'Users can post a wide array of content, including videos and images, to share with a broader audience easily' is true for all three. However, 'This platform is used widely for connecting with others, and also for sharing and consuming information' is extremely broad and could apply to almost any social media platform, including email or messaging apps if interpreted loosely. To be truly misinformed, they must be equally true for Facebook and TikTok.",5,"The 'fake' clues are designed to mislead. 'This platform is known for its extensive network of connections, allowing users to communicate and share easily' strongly points to Facebook. 'It is a platform where users can post short-form videos, often featuring music, and share them quickly online' clearly points to TikTok. Neither describes Instagram specifically enough to be confused with it in this context.",,3,"The informed clues are excellent and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer. The misinformed clues, as currently written, are too vague or too specific to be effective at creating ambiguity. The fake clues are good at misdirection. The overall balance leans towards moderately difficult.",The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted and specific to Instagram. The fake clues are also effective at misdirecting to Facebook and TikTok. The misinformed clues need significant revision to meet the criteria of being equally true for all choices and creating productive ambiguity. They are currently too vague or too specific.,14,14,100%,16.9
2,Technology,1,Operating System,"Operating System, Programming Language, Database",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Operating System' without using any direct keywords or synonyms. They cover various aspects like hardware management, user interaction, and resource allocation from different angles, making them precise and informative.",1,"These clues are far too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for all incorrect answers. 'Fundamental element in modern technology' and 'crucial component that helps a device to function' could apply to a programming language or a database in some contexts, but not universally or in a way that creates productive ambiguity. They are closer to being 'informed' for all options rather than 'misinformed'.",5,"The first fake clue strongly points to 'Programming Language' by mentioning 'developers create instructions' and 'execute them'. The second fake clue clearly describes 'Database' with 'storing, retrieving, and managing data'. Both are highly effective at misdirecting the player away from 'Operating System'.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are excellent and clearly point to the correct answer. The 'fake' clues are also very strong in misdirecting to specific incorrect answers. The 'misinformed' clues are the weakest link, being too vague to be useful, but the overall balance with strong informed and fake clues creates a moderate difficulty.","The 'informed' and 'fake' clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The 'misinformed' clues are underdeveloped and do not meet the criteria for productive ambiguity. The difficulty is moderate due to the strength of the informed and fake clues, despite the weakness of the misinformed ones.",15,15,100%,16.0
2,Technology,2,Windows,"Windows, macOS, Linux",4,"The clues are generally good and point towards Windows without explicitly naming it. Some clues could be slightly more distinct, but they fulfill the criteria of being precise and descriptive.",4,"The misinformed clues create good ambiguity. They are factually true for all three operating systems, forcing the player to look for more subtle distinctions from the informed clues. The ambiguity is productive.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Linux ('collaborative system', 'modify and distribute freely'). The second clue, while factually true for all, is often a point of pride and discussion for Linux users, making it a plausible misdirection. They effectively avoid any mention of Windows.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to narrow down the options, but the misinformed and fake clues provide enough plausible alternatives to prevent it from being too easy. The player needs to carefully weigh all clues.","A well-constructed set of clues for the disinformer game. The informed clues are specific enough to point towards Windows, while the misinformed clues are general enough to apply to all options. The fake clues are particularly effective at misdirecting towards Linux.",15,15,100%,16.3
3,Technology,1,Cloud Service,"Cloud Service, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively pointing to 'Cloud Service' without using any forbidden words. They cover key aspects like on-demand resources, accessibility, scalability, pay-as-you-go models, infrastructure management, security, virtualization, and collaboration.",2,"The misinformed clues are too vague. While factually true for 'Cloud Service', they are also overly general and could apply to 'Cybersecurity' and 'Artificial Intelligence' in a broad sense (e.g., both can use digital technology to improve efficiency and involve complex systems/networks). They don't create productive ambiguity as they are almost trivially true for all options.",5,These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. The first clue perfectly describes 'Cybersecurity' by focusing on protection from unauthorized access. The second clue clearly defines 'Artificial Intelligence' by mentioning machine learning and human-like tasks. Both are completely unrelated to 'Cloud Service'.,,3,"The 'informed' clues are strong enough that a knowledgeable player could likely identify the answer. However, the 'misinformed' clues, while weak, might cause a slight pause for less experienced players. The 'fake' clues are very effective misdirectors. Overall, it strikes a good balance.","The 'informed' clues are well-crafted and specific. The 'fake' clues are excellent and highly effective misdirectors. The 'misinformed' clues are too vague and do not create sufficient ambiguity, which is a weakness. However, the strength of the other clue types compensates for this.",14,14,100%,16.1
3,Technology,2,Amazon Web Services,"Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to AWS without using any keywords from the answer or choices. They cover a good range of features and capabilities.",1,"These clues are too vague and are essentially definitions of cloud computing in general, which applies equally to all choices. They do not create productive ambiguity and fail to meet the critical requirement of being true for all incorrect answers without distinguishing them. They are essentially 'fake' informed clues as they don't provide any distinguishing information for the misinformed category.",5,"These clues are designed to sound like definitions of cloud services but are so generic they could apply to any of the options. They are not specifically pointing to incorrect choices, but rather are so broad they fail to differentiate at all, thus failing to be 'fake' in the intended sense of misdirecting to a *specific* wrong answer. However, in the context of the game, they are ineffective for the purpose of misdirection as they are too general.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to identify the correct answer for someone familiar with cloud services. The misinformed and fake clues are problematic in their lack of specificity and ambiguity, which makes them less effective in creating difficulty, leaning more towards 'too easy' if the informed clues are understood.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The misinformed and fake clues are problematic; they are too generic and do not effectively create ambiguity or misdirection. They should be rewritten to be factually true for all incorrect answers while remaining factually true for the correct answer, and the fake clues should be more targeted to specific incorrect options.",14,14,100%,16.1
4,Technology,1,Streaming Platform,"Streaming Platform, Music App, Podcast App",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using phrases like 'video content on demand', 'vast library of TV shows, movies', and 'subscription-based service'. They avoid any answer words or synonyms and clearly point to 'Streaming Platform' without ambiguity.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'This technology provides entertainment and information that can be accessed by the users anywhere and anytime' is true for Music App and Podcast App, but 'information' is not a primary function of a Music App. Similarly, 'This application is a popular way to deliver digital content to a wide audience on various devices today' is also too general and doesn't provide the necessary ambiguity. They also fail to be true for the correct answer ('Streaming Platform') as they are too broad.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of misdirection. They directly and accurately describe 'Music App' and 'Podcast App' using terms like 'audio content', 'music and podcasts', and 'music streaming'. They effectively pull the player away from the correct answer by strongly suggesting the incorrect ones.",,3,"The clear distinction between the highly specific 'informed' clues, the completely unhelpful 'misinformed' clues, and the strongly misleading 'fake' clues creates a balanced difficulty. Players must recognize the limitations of the 'misinformed' clues and focus on the 'fake' clues to be effectively misled, while the 'informed' clues provide the ultimate confirmation for those who can parse them correctly.","The 'informed' clues are well-crafted and specific. The 'fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting players to the incorrect choices. The 'misinformed' clues, however, fail to meet the core requirement of being true for all options and are too vague, thus not contributing to productive ambiguity. This makes the game lean more on distinguishing between 'informed' and 'fake' rather than leveraging the 'misinformed' category effectively.",14,14,100%,16.6
4,Technology,2,Netflix,"Netflix, Disney+, Hulu",4,"The clues are specific and descriptive, clearly pointing towards Netflix without using direct answer words or synonyms. They highlight original programming, critical acclaim, and cultural impact, which are strong differentiators.",2,These clues are too vague and could apply to almost any streaming service. They lack the 'productive ambiguity' needed to mislead effectively without being completely useless. They are true for all choices but offer no real confusion.,5,"The first fake clue strongly points to Disney+ due to its focus on animated and family-friendly content. The second clue, while technically true for all, could be interpreted as more specific to a service that *popularized* the subscription model in its current form, potentially nudging towards Hulu or Disney+ depending on interpretation, but the first clue is the stronger misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to likely lead to the correct answer for knowledgeable players, while the fake clues provide a plausible, but ultimately incorrect, direction. The misinformed clues are too weak to significantly impact difficulty.",The informed clues are well-crafted and specific. The fake clues are effective at misdirecting towards Disney+. The misinformed clues need to be more ambiguous and less universally applicable to create better confusion.,14,14,100%,16.0
5,Technology,1,Smartphone,"Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet",5,"Clues are highly specific to the 'Smartphone' without using the word itself or direct synonyms. They highlight key functionalities like communication, information access, portability, and integration of various tools. The variety of phrasing covers different aspects effectively.",2,"These clues are too general and could apply to a laptop or tablet with minimal stretch. They focus on 'electronic gadget,' 'communication,' and 'accessing information,' which are shared by all three choices to some degree, but they lack the nuance to create productive ambiguity. They don't strongly point towards the smartphone while still being true for others.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They specifically describe a 'portable computer,' 'personal use,' 'processing capabilities,' 'storage space,' and 'versatility,' which are strong descriptors for a 'Laptop' and could also apply to a 'Tablet' to some extent, effectively steering players away from the correct answer 'Smartphone.'",,4,"The informed clues are very strong, leading directly to the answer. However, the misinformed clues are weak and don't offer much confusion, while the fake clues are very effective at misdirection. This creates a situation where players might quickly identify the answer from the informed clues, or get significantly misled by the fake ones, making it lean towards harder.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, providing precise yet non-obvious pointers to the 'Smartphone.' The fake clues are also very effective, strongly suggesting 'Laptop' or 'Tablet.'

5,Technology,2,iPhone,"iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel",4,"The clues are generally good and point to the iPhone's ecosystem, design, and user experience. There's a slight overlap in phrasing between some clues, but they avoid directly naming the product or its direct synonyms. The clue about 'impacting the mobile technology industry' is strong.",2,"These clues are too generic. While factually true for all smartphones, they don't create productive ambiguity. They are too broad to be helpful in distinguishing between the options. They don't offer any specific shared characteristics that could lead to confusion beyond the fact that they are all phones.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Samsung Galaxy (foldable screen, advanced cameras, versatility) and the second points to Google Pixel (open-source OS, customization). They are plausible descriptions for the incorrect choices and completely avoid any connection to the iPhone.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, but not so obvious as to be trivial. The fake clues are strong misdirectors, increasing the challenge. The misinformed clues are too vague to significantly impact difficulty.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted. The misinformed clues need to be more specific to create productive ambiguity. The overall balance leans towards a moderate difficulty.,14,14,100%,16.9
6,Technology,1,Payment System,"Payment System, Cryptocurrency, Banking App",4,Clues are specific and avoid answer contamination. They cover different aspects of the payment system. Clue 8 is slightly long but acceptable.,2,"The misinformed clues are too general and do not create productive ambiguity. They could be true for many things beyond the given choices, making them less effective at confusing the player. 'Digital tools and systems' and 'exchange value' are extremely broad.",5,The fake clues are excellent. They directly and accurately describe the incorrect choices ('Cryptocurrency' and 'Banking App') and are completely unrelated to the correct answer ('Payment System').,,3,"The strong fake clues and decent informed clues balance out the weak misinformed clues, leading to a moderate difficulty level. Players will need to carefully distinguish between the specific functions of a payment system and the broader definitions of the other options, while also being misled by the fake clues.","The fake clues are the strongest element of this set, effectively misdirecting players. The informed clues are good, providing specific details. The misinformed clues need significant improvement to create more targeted ambiguity without being too vague.",14,13,93%,16.1
6,Technology,2,PayPal,"PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay",4,"Clues are descriptive and point well to PayPal, avoiding direct answer words. Some clues like 'buyer protection policies' and 'international money transfers' are quite specific to PayPal's offerings.",1,"These clues are too vague and could apply to almost any digital payment service, including Venmo and Apple Pay. They don't create productive ambiguity as they are too generic and don't sufficiently overlap with the specific features of the correct answer.",5,"These clues effectively misdirect to Venmo, focusing on social features and bill splitting, which are strong associations with Venmo and not PayPal.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are strong enough to guide towards PayPal, while the 'fake' clues effectively misdirect to Venmo.

They cover various aspects of the web browser's functionality and purpose from different angles, making them excellent 'informed' clues.",1,"These clues fail the critical requirement of being true for all incorrect answers. The first clue ('access and interact with digital content on the internet') is true for all choices, but the second ('essential software used by many people to perform a variety of online tasks') is also true for all. However, the goal is shared truth for *all* incorrect options, and these are too general to be productive. They don't create ambiguity for the *incorrect* choices as intended, but rather are too broad for all. They also don't meet the 'avoid specificity' rule well, as 'digital content' and 'online tasks' are still quite specific.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue perfectly describes an 'Email Client', and the second perfectly describes 'Video Conferencing'. They are completely unrelated to 'Web Browser' and strongly point to the incorrect options.",,4,"The strong 'fake' clues and the very specific 'informed' clues create a challenging game. The 'misinformed' clues are too weak to be helpful or harmful, but the overall balance leans towards difficult due to the clear misdirection and precise information.",Excellent 'informed' and 'fake' clues. The 'misinformed' clues need significant revision to be truly ambiguous and shared across all incorrect options. The difficulty is high due to the quality of the other clue types.,15,15,100%,16.5

Some clues could be slightly more distinct, but overall they are good.",2,"These clues are too general. While true for a game console, they are also true for a Desktop PC and arguably Virtual Reality. They don't create enough productive ambiguity to be effective misinformers. They are too close to being 'informed' clues for the broader category of electronic entertainment devices.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Desktop PC' ('professional tasks', 'content creation', 'data analysis') and the second clue strongly points to 'Virtual Reality' ('immersive manner', 'computer-generated environments'). They effectively steer players away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the fake clues are very effective at misdirection.
