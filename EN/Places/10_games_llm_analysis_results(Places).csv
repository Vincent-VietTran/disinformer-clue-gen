1,Places,1,Natural Feature,"Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'geological processes,' 'distinctive geological formations,' 'diverse ecosystems,' 'untouched beauty,' and 'pristine environments' which strongly point to 'Natural Feature' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. The variety of descriptive angles is excellent.",3,"These clues are true for all three categories (Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site) as people visit all of them for recreation and tourism. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on the shared aspect of being visited and their presence in various locations. The ambiguity is productive because it forces the player to consider the *reason* for the visit or the *nature* of the location, which the 'Informed' clues then differentiate.",5,"These clues are perfectly crafted to misdirect towards 'Urban Landmark' and 'Historical Site' by focusing on construction, human history, societal evolution, cultural shifts, and preserved events. They completely avoid any connection to natural processes or untouched environments, making them highly effective at steering players away from the correct answer.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are quite strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively clear if analyzed carefully. However, the 'Misinformed' clues provide enough common ground to create a brief moment of consideration, and the 'Fake' clues are very convincing for the incorrect options. This balance makes it a moderate difficulty.","The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct descriptors for the correct answer. The 'Misinformed' clues successfully identify a shared characteristic across all options, creating ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards the incorrect choices by focusing on human construction and historical significance.",15,15,100%,16.6
1,Places,2,Grand Canyon,"Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, Great Barrier Reef",5,"The informed clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language that directly points to the Grand Canyon without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They focus on geological features, scale, and the role of the Colorado River, which are unique identifiers.",3,"These clues are true for all options as they are all popular tourist destinations known for their beauty and unique opportunities. However, they are quite general and don't create strong ambiguity. They fulfill the intersection requirement but lack significant misdirection.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Niagara Falls. They focus on 'immense flow of water,' 'falling cascade,' and 'water erosion' in a way that is perfectly descriptive of Niagara Falls and completely irrelevant to the Grand Canyon.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify if one is familiar with the Grand Canyon. The misinformed clues are not strong enough to create significant confusion, and the fake clues are very targeted. The difficulty is moderate due to the quality of the informed clues.",The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the Grand Canyon. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to Niagara Falls. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but lack the depth of ambiguity to be truly challenging.,15,15,100%,17.5
2,Places,1,Landmark,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",4,"The clues are good and descriptive, avoiding direct synonyms. They effectively point to 'Landmark' by highlighting its role as a recognizable, symbolic, and historically significant point of reference often visited by tourists and depicted in media. There is no answer contamination.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three options (Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins). They focus on the shared aspect of being places visited by people and sources of wonder/inspiration. The ambiguity is present as all three can fit these descriptions, creating some confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting to 'Monument' and 'Ancient ruins'. They focus on construction for honor/commemoration and detailed architectural styles, which are highly characteristic of monuments and ruins, and less so for the broader category of landmarks (which can be natural). They completely avoid describing the core aspects of a landmark.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, but the misinformed clues create enough ambiguity with the 'Monument' and 'Ancient ruins' options to make it challenging but not impossible. The fake clues are strong misdirectors.","The informed clues are well-crafted and avoid direct synonyms. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by focusing on shared characteristics. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options, particularly 'Monument' and 'Ancient ruins', by highlighting features not central to the definition of 'Landmark' itself.",15,15,100%,17.5
2,Places,2,Mount Everest,"Mount Everest, Fuji Mountain, Fansipan Mountain",5,"The clues are highly specific to Mount Everest without using any direct words or synonyms. They focus on its status as the world's highest peak, the extreme conditions, the global appeal to climbers, its geographical location as a border, and the inherent dangers and rewards of ascending it. The clues effectively isolate Everest from Fuji and Fansipan.",2,"These clues are too general and don't effectively create ambiguity between the choices. While true that all three mountains are natural beauties and tourist destinations, the clues are so broad that they could apply to almost any famous mountain. They fail the 'elimination test' because they don't provide enough information to distinguish any of the options. They are factually accurate for all but lack productive confusion.",4,"These clues are designed to strongly point towards Fuji Mountain (cherry blossoms) and potentially Fansipan (historical sites, though less strongly). They completely avoid any characteristics of Mount Everest, making them effective misdirection towards the incorrect choices.",,4,"The informed clues are excellent and very specific to the correct answer, making it identifiable. However, the misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are very good at misdirecting to the wrong answers. This combination, with strong fake clues and weak misinformed clues, makes the game challenging by relying heavily on avoiding the fake options rather than being confused by the misinformed ones. The difficulty is elevated by the strong misdirection from the fake clues.","The informed clues are top-notch, precisely describing Mount Everest without any contamination. The fake clues are also strong, effectively misdirecting to Fuji and Fansipan. The misinformed clues are the weakest part, being too general and not creating genuine ambiguity. The difficulty is pushed higher by the effectiveness of the fake clues.",15,15,100%,17.8
3,Places,1,Ancient ruins,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid answer words. They strongly point to 'Ancient ruins' by highlighting remnants of past civilizations, survival over centuries, glimpses into art/architecture/technology, and historical significance. Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other, but overall they are good.",3,"These clues are true for all options. 'Places of cultural and historical importance' applies to all three. 'Offering insights into human history and the development of societies' also applies to landmarks, monuments, and ancient ruins. They create ambiguity by being broad enough to fit each category to some degree, fulfilling the intersection requirement.",4,"The fake clues are effective. 'A structure designed to honor a leader or commemorate a significant event' strongly points to 'Monument'. 'A notable construction, typically designed for public use, that serves as a symbol of a city or region' points well to 'Landmark'. The third fake clue, 'A natural formation that has been recognized for its unique geological features and aesthetic appeal,' is a very good misdirection for 'Landmark' as well, and avoids 'Ancient ruins' entirely.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, but the misinformed clues create enough ambiguity to make it challenging. The fake clues are also plausible misdirections. The balance seems appropriate for a moderate difficulty.",The informed clues are strong and descriptive. The misinformed clues successfully identify the intersection of all choices. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect towards 'Monument' and 'Landmark'. The game has good clarity and difficulty.,15,15,100%,17.5
3,Places,2,Pyramids of Giza,"Machu Picchu, Stonehenge, Pyramids of Giza",5,"The clues are highly specific to the Pyramids of Giza, using descriptive language that avoids any ambiguity. They cover construction, location, purpose, and architectural style, all without using any keywords or direct synonyms. The score is high because they precisely target the correct answer and effectively rule out the others.",3,"These clues are true for all three locations. They are popular tourist destinations recognized for their historical and cultural significance. This creates genuine ambiguity as all are ancient, architecturally significant sites that attract visitors interested in history. The clues are factually accurate for all options and do not contain distinguishing details that would eliminate any choice. They are a good intersection of shared truth.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first and third clues strongly point to Machu Picchu with descriptions of Andean location, intricate stonework, terraces, and Incan artistry. The second clue clearly describes Stonehenge with its circular arrangement of standing stones and debated purpose. None of these clues relate to the Pyramids of Giza, making them excellent misdirection.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are very strong, making it easy to identify the correct answer if one is familiar with the sites. However, the 'misinformed' clues are well-crafted to create a plausible intersection of truth, requiring careful consideration. The 'fake' clues are also strong misdirectors. This combination creates a balanced difficulty.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by identifying common traits of all three locations. The fake clues are well-designed to pull players towards the incorrect options. The overall set provides a good challenge.,15,15,100%,16.3
4,Places,1,Monument,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",5,"The clues are highly specific to the concept of a monument, using descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or variations of the answer word. They focus on purpose, construction, materials, and societal impact, all strongly pointing to 'Monument'.",3,"The misinformed clues are true for all three choices ('Landmark', 'Monument', 'Ancient ruins') as they all represent places of interest with historical or cultural significance and are often tourist destinations. This creates genuine ambiguity. The clues are factually accurate for all options and don't eliminate any.",5,"The 'fake' clues are excellent at misdirecting towards 'Ancient ruins'. They describe remnants, remote locations, and easily eroded materials, which are characteristic of ancient sites but not typically monuments or general landmarks. They are completely unrelated to the correct answer 'Monument'.",,3,"The difficulty is moderate. The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues create enough plausible overlap to require careful consideration. The fake clues are very effective misdirection, increasing the challenge.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to 'Monument'. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by identifying shared characteristics across all options. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting players towards 'Ancient ruins'.,15,15,100%,16.5
4,Places,2,Taj Mahal,"Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately portraying the Taj Mahal without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They effectively differentiate it from the other choices.",3,"These clues are true for all three choices (Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty) in that they are all famous, widely recognized structures visited by millions of tourists. They create ambiguity by focusing on general characteristics shared by landmarks but don't offer enough distinguishing information to be easily eliminated, thus fulfilling the criteria for a good misinformed clue.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of fake clues. They are highly descriptive and accurately point to the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty, respectively, while being completely unrelated to the Taj Mahal. They are plausible and designed to strongly mislead towards the incorrect options.",,3,"The informed clues are quite specific, making the correct answer identifiable. The misinformed clues provide a good level of ambiguity, and the fake clues are strong distractors. This combination creates a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific.

5,Places,1,Country,"Country, Continent, Region",5,"The clues are highly specific to the concept of a 'Country' by consistently mentioning government, territory, borders, sovereignty, and distinct identity. They avoid any ambiguity and directly point to the correct answer without using the word itself or direct synonyms.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for 'Country', 'Continent', and 'Region' as they all represent areas on Earth inhabited by people or with historical significance. They create ambiguity by being general enough to apply to all choices, but they don't offer particularly deep or thematic misdirection. They are a good intersection of truth.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Continent' by emphasizing 'massive area of land encompassing multiple nations,' 'large landmass, including many countries,' and 'very large land area.' They completely avoid characteristics of a 'Country' and are designed to strongly point to 'Continent'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear. The fake clues are also quite strong in misdirecting to 'Continent'. The misinformed clues are adequate but not exceptionally deceptive. This combination leads to a moderate difficulty level where a player needs to carefully distinguish between the nuances of the informed clues and the misdirection of the fake ones.",The informed clues are excellent and precisely define 'Country'. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Continent'. The misinformed clues are factually accurate for all options and create a decent level of ambiguity.

5,Places,2,China,"China, Japan, India",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to China without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover various aspects like history, culture, population, and economy.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for China, Japan, and India. They focus on shared characteristics like having a large population (though varying degrees) and a significant global impact (again, varying degrees). They create ambiguity because all three nations have these attributes to some extent, and the clues are not specific enough to definitively rule out any of them. However, the impact is less about shared essence and more about broad, overlapping truths.",5,The fake clues are excellent. The first points strongly to Japan. The second also points strongly to Japan. The third points strongly to India (Bollywood). None of them relate to China.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer relatively clear. The misinformed clues provide some plausible distraction, and the fake clues are effective misdirection to incorrect options. This combination creates a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted and specific to China. The fake clues are highly deceptive and target incorrect answers effectively. The misinformed clues are adequate in creating some ambiguity, though they rely on broad shared characteristics rather than deeper thematic intersections.",15,15,100%,16.5

They strongly point to 'Continent' without being overly obvious.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Country, Continent, Region) and create genuine ambiguity. They describe a general 'place' or 'area' where humans live and interact, which applies to all three categories, but don't provide distinguishing details.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards 'Country' and 'Region'. The first fake clue directly defines a country, and the third describes a political entity with laws, both strongly pointing to 'Country'. The second fake clue describes a subdivision, which could plausibly be a 'Region' or even a 'Country' within a larger context, effectively diverting from 'Continent'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, and the fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect. The misinformed clues are also appropriately ambiguous. This combination should provide a good challenge without being overwhelmingly difficult.","This set of clues is well-constructed for the disinformer game. The informed clues are precise, the misinformed clues create genuine ambiguity, and the fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players to incorrect answers, particularly 'Country' and 'Region'.",15,15,100%,16.3
6,Places,2,Asia,"Africa, Asia, Europe",5,"Clues are highly specific and descriptive, using strong paraphrases that accurately point to Asia without using any answer words or synonyms. They cover size, population, diversity of culture, landscape, and history. No answer contamination or vagueness.",3,"These clues are true for all three continents (Africa, Asia, Europe) to some extent. 'Diverse cultures' and 'variety of climates' apply to all. However, they are not specific enough to create strong ambiguity, and the intersection of truth is quite broad, making them moderately effective for misdirection.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first strongly points to Africa ('lions, elephants, giraffes, savannas'). The second strongly points to Europe ('ancient ruins, historical sites, diverse European cultures'). The third points to a mountainous and beautiful region, which could plausibly be parts of Europe or Asia but is distinct enough to distract.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed and fake clues provide enough plausible distraction to make it a balanced challenge. The fake clues are particularly effective at misdirecting players.","The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted, adhering strictly to the criteria. The misinformed clues are moderately effective, being true for all options but lacking deep specificity.

7,Places,1,State,"State, City, District",5,"Clues are highly specific and descriptive, using paraphrases that accurately point to 'State' without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like laws, government, territory, and identity within a larger country. No answer contamination or vagueness.",3,"The clues 'This is a place where people live and interact with each other, forming communities and societies.' and 'It is a location that can have a unique identity and culture shared by its residents or inhabitants.' are factually true for State, City, and District. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on commonalities of human settlement and cultural identity, without providing distinguishing details for any single option. The ambiguity is productive for the game.",5,"The 'Fake' clues strongly and plausibly describe 'City' ('densely populated area', 'center of economic activity', 'cultural events, leisure activities, and various services') while being completely unrelated to 'State'. This provides excellent misdirection to an incorrect choice.",,3,"The informed clues are precise, and the misinformed clues create reasonable ambiguity. The fake clues are strongly misleading towards 'City'. This combination offers a good level of challenge without being overwhelmingly difficult.","The clues are well-crafted.

7,Places,2,Victoria,"Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland",4,"Clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They point well to Victoria, mentioning the Great Ocean Road, gold rush history, and Victorian-era architecture. Some clues are slightly general but collectively strong. No answer contamination.",3,"These clues are true for all Australian states. They are factually accurate for Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, creating genuine ambiguity by focusing on broad characteristics of populated regions within Australia. They don't strongly favor any incorrect option over the correct one, nor do they eliminate any.",4,The 'fake' clues are well-crafted to strongly point to incorrect answers. The first clue about ports and maritime culture points strongly to New South Wales (Sydney). The second clue about deserts and canyons strongly suggests Queensland or Western Australia (though WA isn't an option). The third clue about tropical climate and rainforests points directly to Queensland. They are plausible and avoid any connection to Victoria.,,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to identify Victoria with some knowledge. The misinformed clues are broad enough to create some confusion, and the fake clues are strong distractors. This combination offers a moderate challenge.","The informed clues are good, with specific references to Victoria. The misinformed clues are suitably vague and true for all options. The fake clues are excellent distractors, plausibly pointing to incorrect options without being obviously wrong. The difficulty is well-balanced.",15,15,100%,16.7
8,Places,1,City,"State, City, District",5,"The clues are highly descriptive and avoid any direct mention of the answer. They effectively paint a picture of a city through its characteristics like population density, infrastructure, social activities, and diverse population. The clues are precise and avoid ambiguity.",3,"The misinformed clues are true for all options (State, City, District). 'A location that is often inhabited by people and frequently has buildings and infrastructure and services' applies to all. 'A place that is part of a larger administrative division within a particular country or region' also applies to all. This creates genuine ambiguity as intended.",5,"These clues are designed to strongly point towards 'State' or 'District' while being misleading for 'City'. 'A geographical area defined by specific boundaries, often governed by a central authority or government entity' and 'A subdivision of a larger territory, frequently used for administrative, political, or organizational purposes' are very strong descriptions for State or District, and less defining for City. 'A defined area within a larger region, often used for specific purposes, like voting or census' directly points to District.",,3,The informed clues are excellent and specific to 'City'. The misinformed clues create good ambiguity. The fake clues are strong misdirections towards the incorrect options.

8,Places,2,Hanoi,"Hanoi, Canberra, Washington, D.C.",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive of Hanoi, using details like the Old Quarter, French colonial buildings, street food, and the lake as a central point. They avoid any ambiguity and do not mention any of the other city names or variations.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all four capital cities (Hanoi, Canberra, Washington D.C., and implicitly, even though it's not a capital, it's often discussed in similar contexts of national importance). They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on shared characteristics of capital cities and their governmental roles, without providing specific distinguishing details. The intersection test is met, as all are capital cities with significant government roles and a mix of modern/historical architecture.",4,"These clues are crafted to strongly point towards Washington D.C. The mention of 'iconic monuments and historical landmarks,' 'well-planned layout, wide avenues, and numerous government buildings,' and 'international diplomacy and global affairs' are all highly characteristic of Washington D.C. They effectively misdirect away from Hanoi, which is less known for these specific descriptions compared to D.C.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making Hanoi relatively easy to identify. However, the misinformed clues offer just enough plausible overlap for capital cities to create some initial hesitation. The fake clues are also quite effective in misdirecting to Washington D.C., adding another layer of challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and precise. The misinformed clues successfully identify a shared characteristic of all capital cities. The fake clues are well-designed to point towards Washington D.C. The difficulty is balanced, with strong informed clues making the correct answer discoverable, but the misinformed and fake clues adding sufficient challenge.",15,15,100%,17.1
9,Places,1,Commercial,"Commercial, Industrial, Residential",5,"Clues are highly specific to 'Commercial' without using forbidden words. They focus on the exchange of goods, services, retail, offices, entertainment, transactions, trade, economic activity, customer access, and visitor amenities, all directly pointing to the commercial nature of the area.",3,"The clues 'This is a place where people can gather, interact, and engage in various activities for different reasons.' and 'It is a location designed to accommodate human activity and is often a center of economic activity.' are true for Commercial, Industrial (workers gathering, economic activity of production), and Residential (people gathering, economic activity of local services/value). They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on shared aspects of human activity and economic function without being overly specific.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. 'This is an area where factories and manufacturing plants are typically located, focusing on production.' strongly points to Industrial. 'This type of area is primarily designated for housing and living, providing shelter for residents.' strongly points to Residential. 'A location with large-scale production, warehousing, and logistics operations is often present there and active.' also strongly points to Industrial. They completely avoid 'Commercial' and are highly plausible for their intended targets.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making 'Commercial' relatively easy to identify. However, the misinformed clues provide enough plausible overlap with other categories to prevent it from being a 1 or 2, requiring some thought to differentiate.",The informed clues are exceptionally well-crafted and specific.

They create genuine ambiguity as intended.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first points strongly to West Edmonton Mall, the second to The Dubai Mall, and the third could plausibly apply to either of the incorrect options by focusing on water features or unique design elements that might be associated with them, while completely avoiding any mention of Chadstone.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to narrow down the options, but the misinformed and fake clues provide enough plausible misdirection to make it challenging enough for a game.","The informed clues effectively describe Chadstone without using answer words.

The fake clues are excellent at misdirecting to the incorrect choices, significantly increasing the game's difficulty.",15,15,100%,16.9
10,Places,1,Historical Site,"Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using nuanced language that directly points to the concept of historical sites without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like preservation, storytelling, architecture, cultural value, and educational purpose, all of which are strongly associated with historical sites.",3,"These clues are factually true for all answer choices. 'Visited by tourists' and 'cultural or historical value' can apply to natural features (national parks), urban landmarks (Eiffel Tower), and historical sites (Colosseum). 'Symbol of a certain culture' also applies broadly. The ambiguity is genuine, making it a good misinformed clue.",5,These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first and third clue strongly point to 'Natural Feature' by mentioning geological characteristics and formations. The second clue strongly points to 'Urban Landmark' by describing a bustling center of human activity and diverse population. They are plausible and avoid any hint of 'Historical Site'.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to create ambiguity, and the fake clues effectively misdirect to incorrect options.

10,Places,2,Colosseum,"Colosseum, Stonehenge, Machu Picchu",5,"The clues are precise and descriptive, avoiding answer contamination. They highlight key features and historical context of the Colosseum without being overly obscure. For example, 'constructed for gladiatorial contests' and 'complex system of tunnels' are very specific to the Colosseum.",3,"These clues are true for all choices. 'Impressive structure' and 'iconic symbol of a place' apply to the Colosseum, Stonehenge, and Machu Picchu. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on shared characteristics of famous historical landmarks, making it difficult to distinguish between them based solely on these clues.",4,These clues are designed to mislead towards Stonehenge and Machu Picchu. 'Mystical atmosphere and connection to ancient rituals and celestial alignments' strongly suggests Stonehenge. 'Hidden high in the mountains and is known for its connection to a lost civilization' clearly points to Machu Picchu. They are plausible and avoid any direct mention of the Colosseum.,,3,The informed clues are specific enough to lead to the correct answer if analyzed carefully. The misinformed clues create enough ambiguity to make the player think. The fake clues are strong misdirections to the incorrect options. This balance makes for a moderately challenging game.,"The clues are well-crafted and adhere to the game's requirements.
