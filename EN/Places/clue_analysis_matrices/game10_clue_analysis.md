## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using nuanced language that directly points to the concept of historical sites without using any forbidden words. They cover various aspects like preservation, storytelling, architecture, cultural value, and educational purpose, all of which are strongly associated with historical sites.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all answer choices. 'Visited by tourists' and 'cultural or historical value' can apply to natural features (national parks), urban landmarks (Eiffel Tower), and historical sites (Colosseum). 'Symbol of a certain culture' also applies broadly. The ambiguity is genuine, making it a good misinformed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first and third clue strongly point to 'Natural Feature' by mentioning geological characteristics and formations. The second clue strongly points to 'Urban Landmark' by describing a bustling center of human activity and diverse population. They are plausible and avoid any hint of 'Historical Site'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are precise and descriptive, avoiding answer contamination. They highlight key features and historical context of the Colosseum without being overly obscure. For example, 'constructed for gladiatorial contests' and 'complex system of tunnels' are very specific to the Colosseum.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all choices. 'Impressive structure' and 'iconic symbol of a place' apply to the Colosseum, Stonehenge, and Machu Picchu. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on shared characteristics of famous historical landmarks, making it difficult to distinguish between them based solely on these clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

These clues are designed to mislead towards Stonehenge and Machu Picchu. 'Mystical atmosphere and connection to ancient rituals and celestial alignments' strongly suggests Stonehenge. 'Hidden high in the mountains and is known for its connection to a lost civilization' clearly points to Machu Picchu. They are plausible and avoid any direct mention of the Colosseum.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
