# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 3 | Round 1: Places**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.5 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are descriptive and avoid answer words. They strongly point to 'Ancient ruins' by highlighting remnants of past civilizations, survival over centuries, glimpses into art/architecture/technology, and historical significance. Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other, but overall they are good.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all options. 'Places of cultural and historical importance' applies to all three. 'Offering insights into human history and the development of societies' also applies to landmarks, monuments, and ancient ruins. They create ambiguity by being broad enough to fit each category to some degree, fulfilling the intersection requirement.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The fake clues are effective. 'A structure designed to honor a leader or commemorate a significant event' strongly points to 'Monument'. 'A notable construction, typically designed for public use, that serves as a symbol of a city or region' points well to 'Landmark'. The third fake clue, 'A natural formation that has been recognized for its unique geological features and aesthetic appeal,' is a very good misdirection for 'Landmark' as well, and avoids 'Ancient ruins' entirely.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the Pyramids of Giza, using descriptive language that avoids any ambiguity. They cover construction, location, purpose, and architectural style, all without using any keywords or direct synonyms. The score is high because they precisely target the correct answer and effectively rule out the others.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three locations. They are popular tourist destinations recognized for their historical and cultural significance. This creates genuine ambiguity as all are ancient, architecturally significant sites that attract visitors interested in history. The clues are factually accurate for all options and do not contain distinguishing details that would eliminate any choice. They are a good intersection of shared truth.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first and third clues strongly point to Machu Picchu with descriptions of Andean location, intricate stonework, terraces, and Incan artistry. The second clue clearly describes Stonehenge with its circular arrangement of standing stones and debated purpose. None of these clues relate to the Pyramids of Giza, making them excellent misdirection.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
