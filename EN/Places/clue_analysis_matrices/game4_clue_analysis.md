## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of a monument, using descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or variations of the answer word. They focus on purpose, construction, materials, and societal impact, all strongly pointing to 'Monument'.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are true for all three choices ('Landmark', 'Monument', 'Ancient ruins') as they all represent places of interest with historical or cultural significance and are often tourist destinations. This creates genuine ambiguity. The clues are factually accurate for all options and don't eliminate any.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are excellent at misdirecting towards 'Ancient ruins'. They describe remnants, remote locations, and easily eroded materials, which are characteristic of ancient sites but not typically monuments or general landmarks. They are completely unrelated to the correct answer 'Monument'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
