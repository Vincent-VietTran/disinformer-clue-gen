**Test Run 2 | Round 1: Places**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

Clues are descriptive and avoid direct synonyms of the answer. They cover various aspects like recognition, symbolism, tourism, origin, media representation, protection, historical/cultural significance, and educational value. Some clues lean slightly towards being too specific to 'Landmark' without being overly obvious.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all options (Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins) as they are all places visited by many people and found in diverse locations. However, they lack the specificity to create productive ambiguity; they are almost too general and don't strongly suggest any specific option over others, making them less effective at generating confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Ancient ruins' or potentially 'Monument'. The idea of being 'buried for centuries' strongly points away from 'Landmark' which can be contemporary and above ground. 'Created to celebrate a specific person or event' also leans more towards 'Monument' or historical 'Ancient ruins' rather than the broader concept of a 'Landmark'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are well-crafted and provide solid information about 'Landmark'. The 'Misinformed' clues are factually correct for all options but lack the nuance for productive ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are excellent at misdirecting towards incorrect answers, particularly 'Ancient ruins'.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively pointing to Mount Everest without using any direct or synonymous terms. They cover various aspects like geography, origin, and environmental factors, ensuring a strong connection to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too vague. While technically true for Mount Everest, they are also overwhelmingly true for Fuji Mountain and Fansipan Mountain, which are also natural attractions with scenery and unique landscapes. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so broadly applicable to all choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player towards a location with historical structures and monuments, which is not characteristic of any of the mountain choices. They strongly suggest a historical site, making them excellent deceptive clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The strong 'Informed' clues make the correct answer discoverable, but the 'Misinformed' clues are too broad and the 'Fake' clues are very deceptive, requiring careful consideration of the nuances. This balance leads to a higher difficulty.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Generic/vague clues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing specific details without revealing the answer. The 'Misinformed' clues are too generic and could be improved to offer more targeted ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to non-mountainous historical sites.
