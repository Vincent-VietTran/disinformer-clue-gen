**Average Word Count:** 16.6 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'geological processes,' 'distinctive geological formations,' 'diverse ecosystems,' 'untouched beauty,' and 'pristine environments' which strongly point to 'Natural Feature' without using any forbidden words or synonyms. The variety of descriptive angles is excellent.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three categories (Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site) as people visit all of them for recreation and tourism. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on the shared aspect of being visited and their presence in various locations. The ambiguity is productive because it forces the player to consider the *reason* for the visit or the *nature* of the location, which the 'Informed' clues then differentiate.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are perfectly crafted to misdirect towards 'Urban Landmark' and 'Historical Site' by focusing on construction, human history, societal evolution, cultural shifts, and preserved events. They completely avoid any connection to natural processes or untouched environments, making them highly effective at steering players away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The 'Informed' clues are quite strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively clear if analyzed carefully. However, the 'Misinformed' clues provide enough common ground to create a brief moment of consideration, and the 'Fake' clues are very convincing for the incorrect options. This balance makes it a moderate difficulty.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct descriptors for the correct answer. The 'Misinformed' clues successfully identify a shared characteristic across all options, creating ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards the incorrect choices by focusing on human construction and historical significance.

### Informed Clues: 5/5

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Niagara Falls. They focus on 'immense flow of water,' 'falling cascade,' and 'water erosion' in a way that is perfectly descriptive of Niagara Falls and completely irrelevant to the Grand Canyon.

✅ Strengths:
