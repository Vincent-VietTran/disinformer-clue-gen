1,Food,1,Italian,"Italian, Mediterranean, European",5,"The clues are highly specific to Italian cuisine without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover key aspects like pasta, generational traditions, fresh ingredients, tomatoes, cheese, communal dining, regional specialties, global celebration, cooking techniques, and transforming simple ingredients. The specificity is excellent.",3,"These clues are true for all three options (Italian, Mediterranean, European) as they all involve diverse dishes, fresh/seasonal ingredients, and worldwide enjoyment. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on broad, shared characteristics of these culinary regions. They don't point away from Italian specifically, nor do they strongly point to Mediterranean or European over Italian.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting away from Italian cuisine. The first clue strongly suggests Spanish or Middle Eastern (saffron rice). The second points towards North African or Middle Eastern (spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, stews). The third clearly points to French cuisine (butter, pastries, croissants). They are plausible but entirely unrelated to Italian.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear for someone familiar with the cuisine. The misinformed clues are good at creating some ambiguity, but the fake clues are so strongly pointed elsewhere that they might not cause enough confusion for the intended difficulty level. It's a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Italian cuisine. The misinformed clues effectively capture the intersection of all three options without being too vague or too specific. The fake clues are very well-crafted to misdirect towards other specific cuisines, providing strong counter-options.",15,15,100%,16.9
1,Food,2,Pizza Margherita,"Paella, Pizza Margherita, Croissant",4,"The clues focus on simplicity, quality ingredients, and a classic nature, which strongly points to Pizza Margherita. The clue about 'vibrant colors, reflecting the colors of a flag' is a particularly strong hint for the Margherita (red tomato, white mozzarella, green basil). Some clues could be slightly more distinct from each other, but overall they are good.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options. 'Simple ingredients' can apply to all three. 'Popular food' and 'wide range of flavors and textures' are also applicable to Paella, Croissant, and Pizza Margherita. They create ambiguity by being too general, which is the goal of misinformed clues.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first clue perfectly describes a Croissant. The second clue perfectly describes Paella. The third clue is a bit more generic but leans heavily towards a savory pastry or empanada, which could be a plausible misdirection for a savory dish. They are highly specific to the incorrect options and completely avoid the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong, especially the flag color clue, which makes the correct answer relatively clear for someone familiar with the options. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create initial confusion, and the fake clues are highly deceptive. This balance makes it a medium difficulty.","The informed clues are well-crafted and specific enough to point towards Pizza Margherita, with the flag clue being a standout. The misinformed clues are general enough to apply to all options, fulfilling their purpose. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards Croissant and Paella. The difficulty is well-balanced.",15,15,100%,18.0
2,Food,1,Mexican,"Mexican, Latin American, British",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'corn tortillas,' 'avocados,' 'lime,' 'beans,' 'rice,' and 'handmade flatbreads' which strongly point to Mexican cuisine without using the answer word itself. They avoid ambiguity and are precisely tailored to the correct answer.",1,"These clues are too vague and lack factual accuracy for all choices. 'Cooked and eaten, providing energy and nutrients' is true for all food, but not specific enough to be a good misinformed clue. 'Enjoyed by many people around the world' is also too broad and doesn't create productive confusion.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. They specifically and plausibly describe British cuisine ('potatoes, meat pies,' 'fish and chips,' 'sweet and savory baked goods,' 'afternoon tea rituals') while being completely unrelated to Mexican cuisine, thus strongly misdirecting players away from the correct answer.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer if one is familiar with the cuisine. The fake clues are also very strong and specific to a wrong answer, increasing the difficulty by presenting a compelling alternative. The misinformed clues are weak, which might make the overall game easier if players rely on them, but the strength of the informed and fake clues balances this.","The informed and fake clues are excellent, providing strong signals for the correct and incorrect answers, respectively. The misinformed clues are weak and do not effectively create ambiguity or confusion. The difficulty is appropriate due to the strength of the informed and fake clues.",15,15,100%,17.8
2,Food,2,Tacos,"Empanadas, Tacos, Jerk Chicken",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Tacos' without using any forbidden words. They describe the structure (folded tortilla), common ingredients (seasoned meats, vegetables, sauces, cilantro, onions, lime), serving style (with rice and beans), versatility, cultural prevalence, and social aspect, all of which strongly point to tacos.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three options. Empanadas and Tacos are handheld and have fillings. Jerk Chicken can be part of a meal or snack. The 'diverse culinary experience' and 'combination of flavors and textures' are applicable to all. It creates some ambiguity, but doesn't strongly mislead.",5,"The first clue ('flaky pastry shell') strongly points to Empanadas. The second clue ('spicy jerk seasoning, served with rice and peas') points directly to Jerk Chicken. The third clue ('dough is often filled... baked or fried') could apply to Empanadas or potentially other pastries, but combined with the first, it's highly misleading towards Empanadas. They effectively avoid mentioning tacos.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong for the correct answer, while the fake clues are highly targeted towards the incorrect options. The misinformed clues provide a moderate level of shared truth that could cause some initial confusion but are ultimately less impactful due to the strength of the informed and fake clues.",The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting towards specific incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but could be slightly more ambiguous to increase difficulty.,15,15,100%,17.3
3,Food,1,Chinese,"Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese",5,"The clues are highly specific to Chinese cuisine, using precise descriptions of cooking methods, sauces, staple ingredients, historical context, flavor profiles, ingredient emphasis, dining customs, iconic dishes, and serving utensils. They avoid any overlap with the other choices and use descriptive language that does not contain the answer word or its direct synonyms.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three options (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese) as they all involve food, have long histories, and are significant parts of their respective cultures. They create ambiguity by being general enough to apply broadly to national cuisines. They do not eliminate any options.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirections. The first clue strongly points to Japanese cuisine ('sushi and sashimi'). The second clue is a very good description of Vietnamese cuisine ('fresh herbs, rice noodles, and flavorful broths'). The third clue also strongly suggests Vietnamese cuisine ('fish sauce and lime juice', 'sweet, sour, salty, and spicy'). They completely avoid any connection to Chinese cuisine.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer if one is familiar with the cuisines. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted and could easily lead a player astray if they are not careful or if their knowledge is superficial. The fake clues are also very convincing for the incorrect options. This combination creates a good level of challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the correct answer without contamination. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by identifying shared characteristics of the cuisines. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards the incorrect options, particularly Japanese and Vietnamese, making this a well-balanced and challenging game.",15,15,100%,17.6
3,Food,2,Dim Sum,"Dumplings, Dim Sum, Peking Duck",5,"The clues are highly specific to Dim Sum without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover preparation methods (steaming), serving style (carts), social aspect, and typical ingredients. The clues are precise and avoid ambiguity, strongly pointing to the correct answer.",3,"These clues are true for all three options. Dumplings are small and shared. Dim Sum includes a selection of different ingredients and cooking styles. Peking Duck can be served in small portions (e.g., sliced for pancakes) and shared, and it involves various elements in its preparation and serving. The clues create genuine ambiguity by focusing on general characteristics of shared food experiences and culinary variety.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. The first clue directly and accurately describes Peking Duck. The third clue accurately describes Dumplings. These strongly mislead the player towards the incorrect options by providing highly specific and correct descriptions for them, while completely avoiding any connection to Dim Sum.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer identifiable. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create plausible ambiguity, and the fake clues are highly deceptive, pointing directly to the incorrect answers. This combination requires careful consideration and makes the game challenging.","The informed clues are precise and descriptive, effectively guiding towards the correct answer without being too obvious. The misinformed clues are well-balanced, applying to all options and creating genuine confusion. The fake clues are exceptionally strong, providing accurate descriptions for the incorrect choices, making the misdirection very effective. The overall difficulty is high due to the quality of the misinformed and fake clues.",15,15,100%,16.6
4,Food,1,Japanese,"Japanese, Korean, Indian",4,"The clues are highly specific to Japanese cuisine without using any forbidden words. They effectively highlight the distinct characteristics like presentation, seasonality, umami, and ingredients like rice, noodles, and seafood. The score is 4 because while very good, there's always a slight possibility of overlap with extremely nuanced interpretations of other cuisines, though unlikely.",3,"These clues are factually true for Japanese, Korean, and Indian cuisines in a very general sense. 'Food culture involves preparation and consumption as central' is true for all. 'Uses a variety of spices, herbs, and other ingredients to enhance taste' is also true for all, though the *types* and *intensity* of spices differ greatly. This creates genuine ambiguity, fulfilling the criteria for a score of 3.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Indian cuisine. 'Rich sauces, heavy use of spices, complex preparation,' 'variety of meats, focus on grilled and roasted, stews,' and 'use of dairy, cheese, and butter' are all strongly characteristic of Indian food and distinctly not Japanese. They avoid any overlap with the correct answer and are plausible descriptions for the incorrect choice.",,3,"The informed clues are very specific, pointing strongly to the correct answer. However, the misinformed clues are general enough to create some initial confusion, and the fake clues are strong misdirectors. This balance makes it a moderately challenging game.",The informed clues are excellent and precisely target Japanese cuisine. The misinformed clues are general enough to create ambiguity across all options. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards Indian cuisine. The difficulty is well-balanced.,15,15,100%,17.2
4,Food,2,Sushi,"Sushi, Tempura, Ramen",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language that strongly points to 'Sushi' without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They cover preparation, ingredients, presentation, and cultural context effectively.",3,"Clue 1 ('This food item is known for its visual appeal and the careful arrangement of ingredients on the plate.') is true for all three dishes, as presentation is important for all. Clue 2 ('This dish is often enjoyed in social settings, shared among friends and family, promoting togetherness.') is also true for all three. The ambiguity is present, but perhaps not as deeply nuanced as it could be. The score reflects its factual accuracy for all and its ability to create some confusion.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting to 'Ramen' and 'Tempura'. The first and third clues perfectly describe Ramen, while the second clue strongly describes Tempura. They avoid any mention of rice or raw fish, effectively steering players away from Sushi.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to strongly suggest the correct answer for those who know it well, but the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create genuine confusion. The fake clues are also very strong misdirections. This combination creates a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing a rich and accurate description of Sushi. The misinformed clues successfully identify shared characteristics of all three dishes, creating ambiguity. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards Ramen and Tempura. The overall set provides a good challenge.",15,15,100%,16.3

They effectively narrow down the choices to 'Indian'.,3,"These clues are factually true for Indian, African, and Middle Eastern cuisines in a broad sense (rich history, diverse dishes, unique flavors). They create some ambiguity but are not so specific as to point strongly to any single incorrect option.",5,"These clues are very effective at misdirecting to Middle Eastern cuisine, mentioning grilled meats, couscous, tagines, flatbreads, hummus, baba ghanoush, and falafel, which are not characteristic of Indian food.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, making the correct answer identifiable. The misinformed clues provide some distraction, and the fake clues are highly misleading, creating a balanced difficulty.",The informed clues are excellent.

5,Food,2,Butter Chicken,"Chicken parmesan, Butter Chicken, Jerk Chicken",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to Butter Chicken without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They highlight key ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles unique to Butter Chicken. The use of terms like 'creamy, tomato-based sauce,' 'naan bread or rice,' and 'tandoor' are excellent differentiators.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options. 'Popular and well-known' and 'combining and cooking various components' apply to all three chicken dishes. They create genuine ambiguity as intended, making it difficult to distinguish between the choices based solely on these statements.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards Jerk Chicken. The mention of 'spicy marinade,' 'scotch bonnet peppers,' and 'slow-cooking' are strong indicators of Jerk Chicken, while being completely unrelated to Butter Chicken.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer identifiable for those familiar with the dishes. However, the well-crafted misinformed and fake clues provide sufficient misdirection and require careful consideration, balancing the difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing precise details that clearly identify Butter Chicken. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by being true for all options. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards Jerk Chicken.

6,Food,1,Main Course,"Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert",5,"The clues are highly specific to the concept of a 'Main Course' without using any forbidden words. They focus on its substantial, central, and satisfying nature, effectively guiding the player towards the correct answer.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options (Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert) as they are all 'food items' that are 'prepared and served' for consumption and enjoyment. They create ambiguity by being universally applicable to any part of a meal.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first and third clues perfectly describe 'Appetizer' by focusing on being eaten before the main part and stimulating the appetite. The second clue clearly describes 'Dessert' as a sweet, rich dish at the end of a meal. None of these clues point to 'Main Course'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, and the fake clues are highly deceptive, creating a good balance of challenge. The misinformed clues are broad enough to be true for all but not so specific as to be immediately dismissible.","The informed clues are excellent, precisely defining the target without any overlap. The fake clues are masterfully crafted to describe the incorrect options, providing strong misdirection. The misinformed clues are appropriately generic to create genuine ambiguity across all choices.",15,15,100%,17.6
6,Food,2,Beef Wellington,"Beef Wellington, Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using sophisticated vocabulary ('duxelles', 'prime cut', 'puff pastry', 'seared') that directly points to Beef Wellington without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They highlight the unique preparation and presentation aspects of the dish, making it easy to identify.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three dishes (Beef Wellington, Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara) as they are all prepared and consumed by people, often made with a variety of ingredients, and served hot. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on the most basic shared characteristics of food items, making it difficult to distinguish between them without more specific information.",5,"The 'fake' clues are highly effective in misdirecting players. The first clue perfectly describes Lasagna. The second clue strongly points to Spaghetti Carbonara. The third clue is a bit more general but leans heavily towards Lasagna or a meat-based pasta dish, effectively steering players away from Beef Wellington.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear for those familiar with the dishes. The misinformed clues are basic enough to be true for all but don't offer much in terms of sophisticated misdirection. The fake clues are well-crafted for their respective incorrect answers. Overall, the strong informed clues reduce the difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Beef Wellington. The misinformed clues are appropriately vague and true for all options, creating a baseline of confusion. The fake clues are very well-crafted to describe the incorrect options, particularly Lasagna and Spaghetti Carbonara. The game's difficulty is moderate due to the strong informed clues.",15,15,100%,16.1
7,Food,1,American,"American, British, Tex-Mex",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid direct answer words. They effectively point to the 'American' cuisine by highlighting its melting pot nature, innovation, regional diversity, and common characteristics like bold flavors and generous portions. Some clues could be slightly more precise, but overall strong.",3,"These clues are true for all options but are quite general. 'Consumable enjoyed domestically or commercially' and 'associated with a specific culture or region' are very broad. They don't actively create confusion as they are too generic to strongly suggest any specific option over another, but they don't eliminate any either. They fulfill the intersection requirement.",3,"The first fake clue ('use of spices, herbs, and unique flavors') strongly points to Tex-Mex. The third clue ('fresh ingredients and simple cooking methods') could also lean towards Tex-Mex or even some interpretations of American regional food, but the spice clue is the most potent misdirection. The second clue is too general to be a strong fake.",,3,"The informed clues are good but not so obvious that the answer is immediately apparent. The misinformed clues are a bit too generic to be highly confusing, and the fake clues, while pointing to Tex-Mex, aren't so overwhelmingly deceptive that they make the puzzle too hard. It requires some thought to differentiate.",The informed clues are well-crafted and accurately describe American cuisine without using forbidden words. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but lack the ambiguity to be truly misleading. The fake clues provide a decent misdirection towards Tex-Mex. The overall difficulty is appropriate.,15,15,100%,17.8
7,Food,2,Cheeseburger,"Fried Chicken, Cheeseburger, BBQ Ribs",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid answer contamination. They effectively narrow down the choices to the correct answer without being overly explicit. The variety of clues touches on preparation, common associations, and serving style.",3,"These clues are true for all options (Fried Chicken, Cheeseburger, BBQ Ribs) as they are all types of food, often found in restaurants, and can be associated with specific cultures or regions. The ambiguity is genuine and they don't point to any single option over the others.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player towards 'Fried Chicken' and 'BBQ Ribs'. The description of a 'crispy, golden-brown exterior' and 'juicy meat' strongly suggests fried chicken, while 'slow-cooked to perfection' and 'special sauce' with 'sweet, tangy, and savory flavors' points directly to BBQ Ribs. They completely avoid describing a cheeseburger.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to lead to the correct answer, while the misinformed clues create enough ambiguity to make the player think. The fake clues are strong distractors. This balance creates a moderate level of difficulty.","The informed clues are well-crafted and descriptive, effectively pointing to 'Cheeseburger'. The misinformed clues accurately capture the intersection of all choices.

8,Food,1,Thai,"Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese",5,"Clues are highly specific to Thai cuisine, using terms like galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and wok cooking. They effectively describe the flavor profiles and common ingredients without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. The variety of clues covers different aspects of the cuisine.",3,"These clues are true for all three options to some extent. 'Fresh ingredients and vibrant flavors' applies to all. 'Rice, noodles, and various proteins' also broadly applies. It creates some ambiguity but isn't overly specific to any one wrong choice, making it a decent misinformed clue.",5,"The first clue strongly points to Japanese cuisine (sushi, sashimi, tempura). The second clue points strongly to Vietnamese cuisine (rice paper, pho, banh mi, spring rolls). These are highly effective misdirections away from Thai.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, making the correct answer identifiable. The misinformed clues are broad enough to create some initial confusion, and the fake clues are very targeted towards the incorrect options, creating a good balance of difficulty.",The informed clues are excellent and specific. The misinformed clues are reasonably broad. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the wrong answers. The difficulty seems appropriate.,15,15,100%,16.8
8,Food,2,Pad Thai,"Pad Thai, Tom Yum, Green Curry",5,"Clues are highly specific to Pad Thai, using descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or answer words. They cover key ingredients, flavor profiles, cooking methods, and cultural context, making them excellent pointers to the correct answer without contamination.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all three dishes (Thai cuisine, popular, flavorful). They aim for a broad intersection of 'delicious and satisfying taste' and 'blend of flavors and ingredients.' While true, they are not particularly strong at creating genuine ambiguity as the specific flavors and ingredients of each dish are quite distinct. They are factually accurate for the intersection but lack the subtle misdirection that would score higher.",3,"The fake clues effectively misdirect. The first clue with 'rich broth, rice noodles, and various toppings such as beef' strongly points to Tom Yum. The third clue with 'sushi rice, seaweed, and a variety of fillings' plausibly describes a general category that could lead someone away from Thai food entirely if they are not familiar with the options. The second clue about wasabi and pickled ginger is a direct misdirection towards Japanese cuisine, which is not an option but serves to confuse.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable for those familiar with the options. The misinformed clues are not strong enough to create significant confusion. The fake clues offer some misdirection. Overall, it presents a moderate challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Pad Thai. The misinformed clues are factually accurate for the intersection of all three dishes but lack strong ambiguity. The fake clues provide plausible misdirection towards incorrect options, particularly Tom Yum and general East Asian cuisine.",15,15,100%,16.3
9,Food,1,Middle Eastern,"Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Indian",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using precise language that strongly points to the 'Middle Eastern' answer without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like spices, herbs, flatbreads, grilled meats, dips, fresh vegetables, chickpeas, lentils, nuts, seeds, citrus, and communal dining, all of which are hallmarks of Middle Eastern cuisine.",3,"These clues are true for all options to a degree, creating genuine ambiguity. 'Rich and diverse flavors, often using a variety of spices and fresh ingredients' applies to all three. 'Long history and is influenced by its geographic location and its people's traditions' also applies broadly. The ambiguity is productive as it forces the player to look for more specific differentiators.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue strongly evokes Indian cuisine with 'rice, spices, and curries'. The second points directly to Mediterranean with 'olive oil, fresh vegetables, and seafood'. The third clearly describes Indian cuisine again with 'tandoor ovens, spices, and a variety of breads, rice, and meat dishes'. They are plausible and avoid any overlap with the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are quite strong, making the correct answer discoverable. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create plausible confusion, and the diversity of the informed clues requires careful consideration. This strikes a good balance for a medium difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing strong directional signals without being too obvious or using forbidden language. The misinformed clues are well-constructed to create genuine ambiguity by identifying shared characteristics. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to specific incorrect answers.

9,Food,2,Falafel,"Gyro, Falafel, Paella",5,"The clues are highly specific to falafel without directly naming it. They cover its preparation, ingredients, serving style, and cultural context effectively. No answer words or direct synonyms are used. The clues provide distinct angles that collectively narrow down to falafel.",3,"These clues are true for all three options: Gyro (meat, side dishes, sauces), Falafel (vegetarian, side dishes, sauces), and Paella (rice dish, side dishes, sauces). They create ambiguity by focusing on general characteristics of popular dishes, but don't offer enough specific shared traits to be truly misleading beyond the superficial. They are factually accurate for all.",5,"These clues are excellent fake clues. Each one perfectly describes one of the incorrect options (Paella, Gyro, and a generic Indian rice dish) and is completely unrelated to falafel. They are plausible descriptions designed to strongly mislead the player towards the wrong answers.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to be solvable for someone familiar with the dishes, but not so obvious as to be trivial. The misinformed and fake clues add a good layer of misdirection, making it a balanced difficulty.","The set of clues is well-constructed. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. The fake clues effectively target the incorrect options. The misinformed clues fulfill the criteria of being true for all options and creating some ambiguity, although their misdirection is weaker than the fake clues.",15,15,100%,18.5
10,Food,1,Sweet,"Savory, Sweet, Spicy",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using paraphrases that avoid direct synonyms or the answer word itself. They effectively guide the player towards 'Sweet' by focusing on its connection to desserts, happiness, and specific ingredients like sugar and honey.",3,"These clues are factually true for 'Sweet', 'Savory', and 'Spicy' in that all can be elements of dishes, perceived by taste buds, and enhance food. They create genuine ambiguity by describing fundamental aspects of taste perception and food consumption that apply broadly.",5,These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player. The first clue points strongly to 'Savory' with 'main course' and 'meat and vegetables'. The second clue exclusively targets 'Spicy' with 'burning sensation' and 'pepper'. The third clue also strongly aligns with 'Savory' by mentioning 'savory dishes' and enhancing complexity.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create plausible confusion, and the fake clues are excellent misdirections, balancing the overall difficulty. It's not too easy due to the quality of the misdirection, but not too hard because the informed clues are so precise.",Excellent set of clues. The informed clues are precise and descriptive. The misinformed clues successfully capture the intersection of all tastes. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards 'Savory' and 'Spicy'.,15,15,100%,17.0
10,Food,2,Tiramisu,"Croissant, Tiramisu, Ice Cream",5,"All clues are precise, descriptive, and avoid answer contamination. They clearly point to Tiramisu without ambiguity.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three dessert options (Croissant, Tiramisu, Ice Cream). They describe desserts in general terms ('made using different ingredients', 'enjoyed by many people') which creates genuine ambiguity and doesn't distinguish between them. The ambiguity is productive for the game's purpose.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('flaky and buttery... coffee in the mornings') strongly points to Croissant. The second clue ('frozen treat... hot days, variety of flavors') strongly points to Ice Cream. The third clue ('crispy texture... variety of fillings') could plausibly apply to other pastries or savory items, but in the context of dessert choices, it also serves as misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are very specific to the correct answer, while the misinformed clues are general enough to apply to all choices. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect to specific incorrect answers. This combination provides a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and clearly identify Tiramisu.
