## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.6 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Chinese cuisine, using precise descriptions of cooking methods, sauces, staple ingredients, historical context, flavor profiles, ingredient emphasis, dining customs, iconic dishes, and serving utensils. They avoid any overlap with the other choices and use descriptive language that does not contain the answer word or its direct synonyms.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three options (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese) as they all involve food, have long histories, and are significant parts of their respective cultures. They create ambiguity by being general enough to apply broadly to national cuisines. They do not eliminate any options.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective misdirections. The first clue strongly points to Japanese cuisine ('sushi and sashimi'). The second clue is a very good description of Vietnamese cuisine ('fresh herbs, rice noodles, and flavorful broths'). The third clue also strongly suggests Vietnamese cuisine ('fish sauce and lime juice', 'sweet, sour, salty, and spicy'). They completely avoid any connection to Chinese cuisine.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer if one is familiar with the cuisines. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted and could easily lead a player astray if they are not careful or if their knowledge is superficial. The fake clues are also very convincing for the incorrect options. This combination creates a good level of challenge.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the correct answer without contamination. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by identifying shared characteristics of the cuisines. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards the incorrect options, particularly Japanese and Vietnamese, making this a well-balanced and challenging game.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Dim Sum without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They cover preparation methods (steaming), serving style (carts), social aspect, and typical ingredients. The clues are precise and avoid ambiguity, strongly pointing to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options. Dumplings are small and shared. Dim Sum includes a selection of different ingredients and cooking styles. Peking Duck can be served in small portions (e.g., sliced for pancakes) and shared, and it involves various elements in its preparation and serving. The clues create genuine ambiguity by focusing on general characteristics of shared food experiences and culinary variety.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. The first clue directly and accurately describes Peking Duck. The third clue accurately describes Dumplings. These strongly mislead the player towards the incorrect options by providing highly specific and correct descriptions for them, while completely avoiding any connection to Dim Sum.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
