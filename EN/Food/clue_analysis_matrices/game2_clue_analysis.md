**Test Run 2 | Round 1: Food**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.8 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using terms like 'corn tortillas,' 'avocados,' 'lime,' 'beans,' 'rice,' and 'handmade flatbreads' which strongly point to Mexican cuisine without using the answer word itself. They avoid ambiguity and are precisely tailored to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and lack factual accuracy for all choices. 'Cooked and eaten, providing energy and nutrients' is true for all food, but not specific enough to be a good misinformed clue. 'Enjoyed by many people around the world' is also too broad and doesn't create productive confusion.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are highly effective. They specifically and plausibly describe British cuisine ('potatoes, meat pies,' 'fish and chips,' 'sweet and savory baked goods,' 'afternoon tea rituals') while being completely unrelated to Mexican cuisine, thus strongly misdirecting players away from the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |

| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 4/5 - 🟠 Too Hard |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer if one is familiar with the cuisine. The fake clues are also very strong and specific to a wrong answer, increasing the difficulty by presenting a compelling alternative. The misinformed clues are weak, which might make the overall game easier if players rely on them, but the strength of the informed and fake clues balances this.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed and fake clues are excellent, providing strong signals for the correct and incorrect answers, respectively. The misinformed clues are weak and do not effectively create ambiguity or confusion. The difficulty is appropriate due to the strength of the informed and fake clues.

## 1. Length Compliance

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to 'Tacos' without using any forbidden words. They describe the structure (folded tortilla), common ingredients (seasoned meats, vegetables, sauces, cilantro, onions, lime), serving style (with rice and beans), versatility, cultural prevalence, and social aspect, all of which strongly point to tacos.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three options. Empanadas and Tacos are handheld and have fillings. Jerk Chicken can be part of a meal or snack. The 'diverse culinary experience' and 'combination of flavors and textures' are applicable to all. It creates some ambiguity, but doesn't strongly mislead.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first clue ('flaky pastry shell') strongly points to Empanadas. The second clue ('spicy jerk seasoning, served with rice and peas') points directly to Jerk Chicken. The third clue ('dough is often filled... baked or fried') could apply to Empanadas or potentially other pastries, but combined with the first, it's highly misleading towards Empanadas. They effectively avoid mentioning tacos.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong for the correct answer, while the fake clues are highly targeted towards the incorrect options. The misinformed clues provide a moderate level of shared truth that could cause some initial confusion but are ultimately less impactful due to the strength of the informed and fake clues.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are also very effective at misdirecting towards specific incorrect answers. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but could be slightly more ambiguous to increase difficulty.
