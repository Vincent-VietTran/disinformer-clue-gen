# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 8 | Round 1: Food**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.3 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to Thai cuisine without using any answer words or direct synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like flavor profiles, ingredients, and dining culture.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clues are factually true for all options. 'This cuisine is often prepared using a variety of cooking techniques to create diverse dishes' is true for Thai, Vietnamese, and Japanese. 'This cuisine is enjoyed by people from many different backgrounds and cultures around the world' is also universally true. They offer some ambiguity but might not be the most productive in confusing the player.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to Vietnamese cuisine (fish sauce, fermented), and the second clue is a very strong indicator of Japanese cuisine (raw fish, vinegared rice). They completely avoid any connection to Thai cuisine.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are somewhat generic, and the fake clues are very direct misdirections to the incorrect options. This creates a moderate level of difficulty where careful consideration of the informed clues is needed, and the fake clues are powerful distractors.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but could be more ambiguous. The fake clues are very well-crafted to misdirect. The difficulty is appropriate.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using unique characteristics of Pad Thai without directly naming ingredients or common phrases. They effectively narrow down the possibilities to the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too general. While factually true for Pad Thai, they are also true for Tom Yum and Green Curry (all are well-known, loved, savory, served in restaurants/homes). They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so broad they could apply to almost any popular dish. They fail the '100% factually true for ALL incorrect answers' rule in terms of creating useful ambiguity because they are universally true for all choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Green Curry (coconut milk broth, vegetables, meat/seafood). The second clue points to Tom Yum (complex blend of spices/herbs, often includes meat) or Green Curry. They are highly plausible for the incorrect answers and completely unrelated to Pad Thai.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|

---

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues are too vague to be effective in creating ambiguity.
