## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to Thai cuisine, using terms like galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and wok cooking. They effectively describe the flavor profiles and common ingredients without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. The variety of clues covers different aspects of the cuisine.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options to some extent. 'Fresh ingredients and vibrant flavors' applies to all. 'Rice, noodles, and various proteins' also broadly applies. It creates some ambiguity but isn't overly specific to any one wrong choice, making it a decent misinformed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first clue strongly points to Japanese cuisine (sushi, sashimi, tempura). The second clue points strongly to Vietnamese cuisine (rice paper, pho, banh mi, spring rolls). These are highly effective misdirections away from Thai.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to Pad Thai, using descriptive language that avoids direct synonyms or answer words. They cover key ingredients, flavor profiles, cooking methods, and cultural context, making them excellent pointers to the correct answer without contamination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three dishes (Thai cuisine, popular, flavorful). They aim for a broad intersection of 'delicious and satisfying taste' and 'blend of flavors and ingredients.' While true, they are not particularly strong at creating genuine ambiguity as the specific flavors and ingredients of each dish are quite distinct. They are factually accurate for the intersection but lack the subtle misdirection that would score higher.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The fake clues effectively misdirect. The first clue with 'rich broth, rice noodles, and various toppings such as beef' strongly points to Tom Yum. The third clue with 'sushi rice, seaweed, and a variety of fillings' plausibly describes a general category that could lead someone away from Thai food entirely if they are not familiar with the options. The second clue about wasabi and pickled ginger is a direct misdirection towards Japanese cuisine, which is not an option but serves to confuse.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
