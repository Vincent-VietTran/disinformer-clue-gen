**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of a 'Main Course' without using any forbidden words. They focus on its substantial, central, and satisfying nature, effectively guiding the player towards the correct answer.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all options (Appetizer, Main Course, Dessert) as they are all 'food items' that are 'prepared and served' for consumption and enjoyment. They create ambiguity by being universally applicable to any part of a meal.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first and third clues perfectly describe 'Appetizer' by focusing on being eaten before the main part and stimulating the appetite. The second clue clearly describes 'Dessert' as a sweet, rich dish at the end of a meal. None of these clues point to 'Main Course'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |

| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, and the fake clues are highly deceptive, creating a good balance of challenge. The misinformed clues are broad enough to be true for all but not so specific as to be immediately dismissible.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Generic/vague clues
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, precisely defining the target without any overlap. The fake clues are masterfully crafted to describe the incorrect options, providing strong misdirection. The misinformed clues are appropriately generic to create genuine ambiguity across all choices.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using sophisticated vocabulary ('duxelles', 'prime cut', 'puff pastry', 'seared') that directly points to Beef Wellington without using the answer word or obvious synonyms. They highlight the unique preparation and presentation aspects of the dish, making it easy to identify.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three dishes (Beef Wellington, Lasagna, Spaghetti Carbonara) as they are all prepared and consumed by people, often made with a variety of ingredients, and served hot. They create genuine ambiguity by focusing on the most basic shared characteristics of food items, making it difficult to distinguish between them without more specific information.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are highly effective in misdirecting players. The first clue perfectly describes Lasagna. The second clue strongly points to Spaghetti Carbonara. The third clue is a bit more general but leans heavily towards Lasagna or a meat-based pasta dish, effectively steering players away from Beef Wellington.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear for those familiar with the dishes.

Overall, the strong informed clues reduce the difficulty.

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Beef Wellington. The misinformed clues are appropriately vague and true for all options, creating a baseline of confusion. The fake clues are very well-crafted to describe the incorrect options, particularly Lasagna and Spaghetti Carbonara. The game's difficulty is moderate due to the strong informed clues.
