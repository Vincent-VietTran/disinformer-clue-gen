## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for Indian, African, and Middle Eastern cuisines in a broad sense (rich history, diverse dishes, unique flavors). They create some ambiguity but are not so specific as to point strongly to any single incorrect option.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to Butter Chicken without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They highlight key ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles unique to Butter Chicken. The use of terms like 'creamy, tomato-based sauce,' 'naan bread or rice,' and 'tandoor' are excellent differentiators.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all options. 'Popular and well-known' and 'combining and cooking various components' apply to all three chicken dishes. They create genuine ambiguity as intended, making it difficult to distinguish between the choices based solely on these statements.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
