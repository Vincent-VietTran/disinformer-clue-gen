## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are excellent. They precisely describe the core mechanics and experience of adventure games without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, narrative, and journey, which are hallmarks of the genre. The clues are specific enough to point strongly to 'Adventure' while remaining descriptive and avoiding direct answer words.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all options. 'Interactive entertainment enjoyed by many people across different platforms and devices worldwide' applies to Adventure, RPG, and Action. 'Often involves player interaction, challenges, and the achievement of specific goals or objectives to win' also applies to all three. They create ambiguity by being general enough to encompass all game types.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are very effective at misdirecting. The first clue ('fast-paced combat, using weapons and abilities to defeat enemies') strongly points to 'Action'. The second clue ('customize their characters, develop skills, and easily build relationships') points towards 'RPG'. The third clue ('strategic battles, using tactical planning and resource management') also leans heavily towards 'RPG' or potentially a strategic action game, effectively diverting attention from 'Adventure'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
