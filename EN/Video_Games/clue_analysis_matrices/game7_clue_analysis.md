---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of simulation without using the word 'simulation' or its direct synonyms. They focus on the core mechanics and purpose of simulation games like detailed replication, experimentation without consequences, resource management, and realism. Each clue offers a distinct facet of the genre.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 2/5  
**Fair - Below expectations**

These clues are too general. 'Fun experience with a lot of freedom' and 'strategic thinking and a lot of different choices' can apply to many game genres, including racing and sandbox games, but they don't create enough specific overlap to be truly productive misdirection for the 'Simulation' answer. They are factually true for all options but not in a way that generates strong, shared ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The first fake clue perfectly describes 'Racing' games with its emphasis on high-speed events and vehicle control. The second fake clue strongly points to 'Sandbox' games with its mention of open worlds and player-created adventures. Both are highly effective at misdirecting players away from 'Simulation'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear to someone familiar with game genres. The misinformed clues are weak, and the fake clues are very strong misdirectors. This combination creates a moderate difficulty level where players need to carefully distinguish the precise nature of simulation from the broader descriptions and the specific misdirections.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing clear and distinct characteristics of the 'Simulation' genre. The fake clues are highly effective in misdirecting towards 'Racing' and 'Sandbox'. The misinformed clues are the weakest element, being overly general and not creating significant ambiguity that benefits the game's design.

**Test Run 7 | Round 2: Video Games**

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.3 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to The Sims 4, using terms like 'virtual residents', 'virtual characters', 'Sims', 'virtual people', and 'emotions' which are unique to the game. They clearly distinguish it from the other choices without using forbidden words.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers. 'Manage a lot of aspects and parts of the world they are in and their characters' lives' could be true for The Sims 4, but is not necessarily true for Gran Turismo or Flight Simulator in the same way. 'Immersive experience, allowing players a lot of freedom and choice' is also not equally applicable to all choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting players towards Gran Turismo. They use specific terms like 'race', 'vehicles', 'tracks', 'driving', and 'victory' which are central to racing games but completely irrelevant to The Sims 4.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 2/5 - 🟢 Too Easy |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, and the fake clues are highly misleading towards Gran Turismo. The misinformed clues are weak, but overall the balance leans towards an easier difficulty because the informed clues are so definitive and the fake clues are so good at misdirection.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 3.7/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Enhance misinformed clue ambiguity
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and clearly point to The Sims 4. The fake clues are exceptionally well-crafted to misdirect towards Gran Turismo. The misinformed clues fail to meet the criteria of being true for all choices, which is a significant weakness. The difficulty is on the easier side due to the strength of the informed and fake clues.
