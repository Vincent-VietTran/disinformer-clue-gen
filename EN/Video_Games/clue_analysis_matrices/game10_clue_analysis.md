**Test Run 10 | Round 1: Video Games**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.4 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to the 'Survival' genre without using any direct words or synonyms. They focus on core mechanics like resource management, environmental challenges, crafting, defense, and enduring harsh conditions. The phrasing is precise and descriptive.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three genres (Survival, Adventure, Action) because all games involve being in a digital world, interacting with systems, and completing objectives. They create ambiguity by being broadly applicable, but don't strongly point to any single incorrect answer over the others, which is the goal of misinformed clues.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirecting. The first clue strongly points to 'Action' (fast-paced combat, winning matches). The second clue strongly points to 'Adventure' (quests, exploring worlds, battling enemies, advancing storyline). The third clue also strongly points to 'Action' (intense action, quick reflexes, combat). None of these clues are applicable to 'Survival'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are strong and specific, making 'Survival' identifiable. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to be broadly true but not specifically identifying. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Action' and 'Adventure'. This balance creates a reasonable challenge.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, precisely describing 'Survival' without contamination. The misinformed clues are appropriately vague and true for all options, creating the desired ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Action' and 'Adventure', making them a good counterbalance. Overall, a well-constructed set of clues.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are highly specific to ARK: Survival Evolved, using terms like 'prehistoric creatures,' 'dinosaurs,' and 'tribes' which are central to the game's identity and not shared by the other options. The descriptions are precise and avoid ambiguity. No answer words or direct synonyms are used.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues accurately describe the intersection of Rust and The Forest, and are also true for ARK: Survival Evolved, but in a very general sense. They focus on resource gathering, crafting, building, and survival against threats, which applies to all three games. They create genuine ambiguity without being overly specific or containing distinguishing details.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are designed to strongly misdirect players towards Rust or The Forest. 'Players compete to gather resources, craft items, and outlast other players in a desolate environment' is a very strong description of Rust. 'Players explore a mysterious island, uncovering secrets and battling hordes of monstrous creatures' could easily point to The Forest. These clues avoid any mention of dinosaurs or prehistoric elements, effectively steering players away from ARK.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

This balance creates a moderate level of difficulty.

The informed clues are excellent and precisely identify ARK: Survival Evolved. The misinformed clues successfully capture the shared survival genre elements, creating plausible ambiguity. The fake clues are well-designed to misdirect towards the other options. The overall set of clues presents a balanced challenge.
