## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to the concept of 'Strategy' without using any forbidden words. They cover resource management, decision-making, tactics, foresight, objective prioritization, anticipation, optimization, analysis, and diplomacy, all of which are core components of strategic gameplay.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options. 'A type of entertainment that challenges players to solve problems and achieve objectives through gameplay' applies to Strategy (solving strategic problems), Simulation (solving problems of managing a simulation), and Puzzle (solving explicit puzzles). 'A form of interactive entertainment that offers a simulated experience or a set of rules and goals to follow' also applies broadly. Strategy involves rules and goals, Simulation is inherently a simulated experience, and Puzzle games have rules and goals. The ambiguity is productive and forces the user to consider the nuanced differences.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are well-crafted to point away from 'Strategy' and towards 'Puzzle' and 'Simulation'. The first clue ('Players control characters in a world and complete quests, exploring environments and interacting with others.') strongly suggests an RPG or adventure game, which is neither Strategy, Simulation, nor Puzzle in this context. The second clue ('Players build and manage resources in a virtual setting, creating structures and developing their community.') points directly to Simulation or perhaps a city-builder strategy game, but the wording leans heavily into Simulation. The third clue ('Involves arranging elements to solve puzzles, with each level presenting a unique challenge to overcome with intellect.') is a perfect description of a Puzzle game and directly misleads away from Strategy.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are very specific to Civilization VI, using terms like 'civilization through history,' 'tech tree,' 'city-building and resource management,' 'diplomacy,' 'cultural development, scientific progress, and military prowess,' 'balancing military strength, cultural influence, and economic prosperity,' 'adapting to environmental conditions,' 'diverse historical eras,' and 'explore the world to discover resources and new land.' These are all highly characteristic of the game and its mechanics, and very unlikely to apply to XCOM 2 or StarCraft.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options. 'Interact with a simulated world and make choices that influence the outcome' applies to all. 'Manage resources, develop technologies, and build a successful civilization or empire' also applies to all three games at a high level, though the specifics differ greatly. This creates good ambiguity for a misinformed clue.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first clue perfectly describes XCOM 2. The second and third clues strongly describe StarCraft, especially the real-time aspect and futuristic setting. None of these clues are applicable to Civilization VI.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to identify for someone familiar with the games. The misinformed clues are well-crafted to create ambiguity, but the strength of the informed clues likely outweighs them. The fake clues are excellent at misdirection. Overall, a moderate difficulty.

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to Civilization VI, making them very effective. The misinformed clues are good examples of finding common ground between disparate games. The fake clues are exceptionally well-designed to target the incorrect options and strongly avoid the correct one.
