# Game Clue Analysis Matrix
**Test Run 6 | Round 1: Video Games**

---

## 1. Length Compliance
| Status | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 15.9 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are highly descriptive of puzzle games, using terms like 'logic', 'critical thinking', 'riddles', 'patterns', 'problem-solving', and 'spatial reasoning'. They avoid answer contamination and are specific to the correct answer. The score is not a 5 because some clues could potentially overlap with certain strategy or even some platformer subgenres if interpreted very broadly, but they are predominantly puzzle-focused.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three choices (Puzzle, Strategy, Platformer). They describe interactive entertainment, simulated experiences, and engaging with systems/stories for fun. They create ambiguity because all game types fit this description. The clues are not overly specific and successfully avoid distinguishing details. They are a good intersection of shared truths.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent at misdirecting to incorrect answers. The first clue strongly points to Strategy (base building, resource management, units). The second and third clues strongly point to Platformer (obstacle-filled environments, jumping, running, reflexes, timing, defeating enemies). They completely avoid describing the correct answer, 'Puzzle'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 3. Diversity Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Theme Coverage | ✅ PASS |
| Clue Variation | ✅ PASS |
| Angle Coverage | ✅ PASS |

**Issues Found:** None identified

---

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are quite strong, making the correct answer identifiable. The misinformed clues are good at creating ambiguity by being true for all options. The fake clues are very effective at pointing away from the correct answer and towards specific incorrect ones. This combination creates a balanced difficulty where a player needs to carefully analyze the informed clues while being wary of the misdirection.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.0/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are well-crafted and specific to 'Puzzle'. The misinformed clues successfully capture the intersection of all three choices without distinguishing them. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Strategy' and 'Platformer'. Overall, a well-balanced set of clues for the 'Puzzle' game.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 4/5  
**Very Good - Exceeds expectations**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to 'Portal' without using any forbidden words. They highlight the unique mechanics, puzzle-solving, narrative tone, and impact on the genre. The only slight detraction is that 'Players are challenged to think outside the box and use their understanding of physics to succeed.' could be slightly more general, but it still fits well.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The clue 'This game has a main character that is controlled by the player and interacts with the game world.' is true for all three choices. The clue 'This game is known for its innovative gameplay mechanics and its positive reception from critics.' is also true for all three. They create ambiguity by being universally applicable, fulfilling the intersection requirement. They don't help eliminate options. They avoid plot points or unique mechanics.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The fake clues are excellent. The first one 'The player controls a plumber who must rescue a princess from a fire-breathing dragon in a kingdom.' is a perfect, highly specific description of Super Mario, strongly misdirecting away from Portal. The second fake clue 'The player controls blocks falling from the top of the screen, arranging them to clear lines.' is a precise description of Tetris, also a strong misdirection. The third fake clue is not provided, but the first two are highly effective.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
