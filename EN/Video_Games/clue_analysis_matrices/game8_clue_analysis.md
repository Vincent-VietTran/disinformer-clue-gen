| ✅ PASS | Clues within 15-20 words |

**Compliance Rate:** 100% (15/15 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/15 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.1 words

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to racing games, using terms like 'high-speed competition,' 'vehicles,' 'finish line,' 'skillful driving,' and 'velocity.' They effectively rule out sports and arcade games without explicitly mentioning them.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three categories. 'Players compete against each other or AI in a digital environment, aiming to achieve a specific objective' applies to racing, sports, and arcade games. 'This form of entertainment regularly provides challenges that demand strategic thinking, practiced abilities, and rapid choices to progress' also applies to all three, creating ambiguity.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The 'fake' clues are excellent misdirections. The first one strongly points to 'Sports' ('manage teams,' 'tactical decisions,' 'championships,' 'player development'). The second also points to 'Sports' ('physical activity,' 'endurance,' 'skill,' 'scoring points'). The third clue is a perfect fit for many 'Arcade' games, especially those with combat elements ('weapons,' 'tactics,' 'eliminate opponents,' 'survive').

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are precise and effectively identify 'Racing'. The misinformed clues correctly identify a shared intersection that applies to all choices, creating productive ambiguity. The fake clues are strong misdirections towards 'Sports' and 'Arcade'.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, directly pointing to the unique mechanics and presentation of Mario Kart without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They highlight item usage, character abilities, creative tracks, and innovative mechanics like anti-gravity, all of which are core to Mario Kart.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are true for all three options. 'Competitive gameplay' and 'exciting races with a variety of vehicles and diverse tracks' can apply to Forza Horizon, Mario Kart, and Need for Speed. They create ambiguity by focusing on the general racing genre elements that all share.

⚠️ Concerns:

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
