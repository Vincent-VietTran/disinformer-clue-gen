**Average Word Count:** 16.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately capturing the essence of the 'Shooter' genre without using any prohibited terms. They focus on elements like environments, weapons, combat, projectiles, aiming, and perspectives, all of which are core to shooters and difficult to apply to the other genres.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three genres (Shooter, Fighting, Sports) as they all involve interactive entertainment, challenges, and interaction with virtual worlds. They create ambiguity because they are broad enough to apply to any game, but not so vague as to be meaningless. They don't specifically point to any one genre over the others.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Each fake clue is expertly crafted to strongly and plausibly describe one of the incorrect answer choices (Fighting, Sports, and a Strategy game which isn't an option but the clue is for a genre). The 'Fighting' clue is spot-on for that genre, the 'Sports' clue is perfect for that genre, and the third fake clue, while not directly mapping to an option, describes a common game genre that is distinct from 'Shooter'. They effectively misdirect away from 'Shooter'.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

## 4. Difficulty Rating

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| Rating | 3/5 - 🟢 Just Right |

**Reasoning:** The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one understands the genre. The misinformed clues are good at creating general ambiguity but don't pose a significant challenge to distinguishing the specific genre. The fake clues are well-crafted to misdirect but the highly specific informed clues balance this out.

## Overall Assessment

**Overall Quality Score:** 4.3/5

**Pass/Fail:** ✅ PASS

**Main Issues:**
- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing precise and non-contaminated descriptions of the 'Shooter' genre. The misinformed clues are effective in their broad applicability across genres, creating general ambiguity. The fake clues are strong misdirections towards incorrect genres. The difficulty is balanced.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

The clues are highly specific to Call of Duty without using forbidden words. They cover aspects like yearly releases, military themes, fast-paced action, cover mechanics, and community size, all strongly pointing to Call of Duty.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

These clues are factually true for all three games (Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Halo) as they all feature action, various weapons, and multiple game modes. They create genuine ambiguity by highlighting shared genre elements.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent misdirection. The first describes a survival/crafting game (like Minecraft or ARK, but could be loosely applied to Destiny 2's open world elements). The second strongly points to Destiny 2 with 'guardian' and 'intergalactic threat'. The third clearly describes Halo with its futuristic setting and interstellar battles. They are designed to strongly pull the user away from Call of Duty.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious
