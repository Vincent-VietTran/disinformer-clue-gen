'Digital media that tells stories' applies to all. 'Face challenges, solving problems within structured settings, often requiring strategic planning and quick thinking' can apply to all, though the emphasis on 'strategic planning and quick thinking' might lean slightly towards Strategy. The ambiguity is present but not overly strong, as RPGs and Adventures also involve problem-solving and narrative, while Strategy games are heavily defined by planning. It creates some confusion but doesn't perfectly obscure the correct answer.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting towards Strategy and Adventure. 'Tactical choices, resource allocation, and strategic planning for achieving battlefield victory in combat' strongly points to Strategy.

They are completely unrelated to the correct answer and plausibly describe a wrong choice, earning a high score for misdirection.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. However, the misinformed clues are generic enough to create some initial confusion, and the fake clues are highly deceptive towards a specific wrong answer. This combination, with the strong fake clues pulling attention away, creates a moderate to high level of difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing highly specific and accurate descriptions of the correct answer. The misinformed clues are appropriately generic to create some shared ambiguity.
