1,Nature,1,Mammal,"Invertebrates, Mammal, Vertebrates",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, accurately pointing to 'Mammal' without using any prohibited words or synonyms. They cover various defining characteristics like live birth, nursing, warm-bloodedness, fur, specialized teeth, internal skeleton, cognitive skills, diverse habitats, placental development, four-chambered heart, and thermoregulation.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options (Invertebrates, Mammal, Vertebrates) and create ambiguity. They describe general biological concepts of evolution, adaptation, cellular structure, and genetic material, which apply to all living organisms. The ambiguity is genuine as they don't strongly favor one over the others.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting towards 'Invertebrates'. They describe exoskeletons, lack of backbone, segmentation, metamorphosis, and simple body structures, which are characteristic of many invertebrates and completely exclude mammals and vertebrates in a way that strongly suggests 'Invertebrates' is the intended answer.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer clear if one understands the definitions. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create genuine confusion by being factually true for all options, and the fake clues are highly deceptive, strongly pointing to an incorrect answer. This combination creates a challenging game.",The informed clues are excellent and precisely define 'Mammal'. The misinformed clues are good examples of intersectional truths that provide ambiguity. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards 'Invertebrates'. The difficulty is appropriately high due to the quality of the misdirection.,15,15,100%,16.3
1,Nature,2,African Elephant,"giraffe, African Elephant, Lion",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using varied language that accurately points to the African Elephant without using any forbidden terms. They cover physical characteristics, social behavior, habitat, communication, and biological facts. No answer contamination or overly vague descriptions.",3,"These clues are true for all options (giraffe, African Elephant, Lion) in a very general sense of being animals with notable characteristics. However, they are too vague and don't create genuine ambiguity. The clue about a long neck is too specific to the giraffe, and the predator clue is too specific to the lion. The third clue about social interaction is also too broad. They fail the elimination test as they immediately point away from specific animals.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirecting to the incorrect choices. The first clue perfectly describes a giraffe, the second a lion, and the third also strongly points to a lion. They are designed to be plausible and attractive decoys, completely avoiding any hint of the correct answer.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer identifiable. However, the misinformed and fake clues are well-crafted to create significant misdirection towards the incorrect options, increasing the overall difficulty for players who might be swayed by those descriptions.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too vague and fail to create genuine ambiguity, leaning towards being too specific to individual incorrect answers.

2,Nature,1,Fruits,"Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, using botanical and culinary terms that precisely define 'Fruits' without using the word itself or obvious synonyms. They effectively leverage the defining characteristics of fruits, such as their origin from a flower's ovary, their role in seed dispersal, and their common consumption and culinary uses. The language avoids ambiguity and directly points to the correct answer.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers). They describe items found in grocery stores, used in recipes, and forming part of a healthy diet. This creates genuine ambiguity because fruits, vegetables, and even flowers (in some culinary traditions) can fit these descriptions. However, they are not overly specific and don't strongly point to any single incorrect answer over another, fulfilling the criteria of shared truth and lack of elimination.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. The first clue ('edible roots, stems, or leaves') strongly points to 'Vegetables'. The second clue ('showy petals... beauty... decoration and fragrances') clearly targets 'Flowers'. The third clue ('salads... nutritional value... staple in many cuisines') could also lean towards 'Vegetables' or even 'Fruits' in a broader sense, but the primary targets are 'Vegetables' and 'Flowers', effectively misdirecting away from 'Fruits'.",,3,"The informed clues are quite specific, which helps players identify the correct answer. The misinformed clues provide a reasonable level of ambiguity by highlighting shared characteristics. The fake clues are strong misdirections. This combination creates a balanced difficulty, not too easy and not too hard.","The informed clues are excellent, precisely defining 'Fruits'.

2,Nature,2,Apple,"Apple, Banana, Watermelon",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid answer contamination. They effectively point to 'Apple' by highlighting its common uses, nutritional value, and symbolic associations. Some clues could be slightly more specific to narrow down options further if there were more similar fruits, but for this set, they are strong.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options (Apple, Banana, Watermelon) and create ambiguity. They focus on general characteristics of produce (consumption, plant-based, sweetness, nutritional value). The ambiguity is productive as it forces the player to consider the specific details of the 'Informed' clues to differentiate.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirection. The first clue strongly points to 'Banana' (curved shape, potassium, snack). The second clue clearly describes 'Watermelon' (high water content, summer, sliced). The third clue accurately describes a 'Cucumber' if it were an option, but in this context, it might weakly point to a green apple variety or a long melon if the player is unfamiliar with bananas/watermelons, but its primary strength is in misdirecting to hypothetical or other common produce.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are specific enough to guide towards 'Apple', while the 'Misinformed' clues provide a good layer of general confusion. The 'Fake' clues are very strong misdirectors for the incorrect options, making the game balanced.","The clues are well-crafted and adhere to the specified criteria.

3,Nature,1,Insects,"Insects, Arachnids, Myriapods",4,"The clues are highly descriptive and specific to insects without using the answer word or direct synonyms. They cover morphology, life cycle, ecological role, evolutionary history, social behavior, diet, sensory organs, locomotion, and physical structure. The mention of 'three body sections' and 'six legs' is a very strong indicator. 'Metamorphosis' is also a key insect trait. The clue about 'colonies' is good but could also apply to some arachnids or myriapods if interpreted broadly, though the other clues strongly differentiate.",3,"These clues are factually true for insects, arachnids, and myriapods. They are invertebrates, lack a backbone, and are found in nearly every habitat. They also play a role in the food chain and influence ecosystems. The clues are general enough to apply to all three groups, creating genuine ambiguity.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players. The first clue ('eight legs', 'webs', 'hunters') strongly points to Arachnids. The third clue ('two body segments', 'sting', 'hives') strongly points to Hymenoptera within Insects, but is presented as a general characteristic of a category, making it a plausible (though incorrect) descriptor for a distinct group. The second clue ('segmented invertebrates', 'multiple legs', 'humid environments', 'decomposing organic substances') could plausibly point to Myriapods.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer discoverable. However, the misinformed clues are well-crafted to create plausible distractions, and the fake clues are very good at pointing away from the correct answer. This combination makes the puzzle challenging but fair.","A well-structured set of clues. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination. The misinformed clues successfully identify an intersection of shared truths across all options, creating ambiguity.

3,Nature,2,Monarch Butterfly,"Monarch Butterfly, Honey Bee, Ladybug",4,"The clues are descriptive and accurately point to the Monarch Butterfly without using forbidden words or synonyms. They highlight key characteristics like migration, milkweed diet, toxicity, metamorphosis, and pollination role, which are specific to the Monarch.",3,"Clue 1 ('This insect is known for its beautiful colors and plays a vital role in the pollination of plants everywhere.') is true for all three choices to some extent. Monarchs are colorful and pollinators, Honey Bees are colorful and pollinators, and Ladybugs are colorful and can pollinate. Clue 2 ('The lifecycle of this creature includes a larval stage and a pupal stage before reaching adulthood in nature.') is also true for all three as they all undergo complete metamorphosis. The clues create genuine ambiguity.",5,"Clue 1 ('This species is known for its complex social structure and the production of honey as a food source for humans.') strongly points to Honey Bee and is unrelated to Monarch Butterfly or Ladybug. Clue 2 ('This insect is often associated with good luck and is known for its red and black spotted appearance on leaves.') strongly points to Ladybug and is unrelated to Monarch Butterfly or Honey Bee. Clue 3 ('These insects are known for their stinging ability, and they live in colonies to protect their hives.') strongly points to Honey Bee and is unrelated to Monarch Butterfly or Ladybug. These are effective misdirections.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to identify the Monarch, but the misinformed clues provide plausible but ultimately false connections to the other options, requiring careful consideration. The fake clues are strong misdirections.","The set of clues effectively uses informed, misinformed, and fake strategies. The informed clues are precise and avoid answer contamination.

4,Nature,1,Fish,"Fish, Reptiles, Amphibians",4,"The clues are precise and descriptive, effectively pointing to 'Fish' without using the word itself or direct synonyms. They highlight key biological and ecological characteristics. The score is not a 5 because some clues, while accurate, could potentially overlap with very broad definitions of other aquatic animals if not considered in conjunction with the full set.",3,"These clues are factually true for 'Fish', 'Reptiles', and 'Amphibians' as a broad intersection. They are living organisms requiring basic needs. The ambiguity is present, but the clues are somewhat generic, making it a moderate level of misdirection rather than expertly crafted confusion.",4,"These clues strongly and plausibly describe 'Reptiles' and 'Amphibians' (scales, shedding skin, land/water, metamorphosis, lungs) while being completely unrelated to 'Fish'. They are effective at misdirecting players away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer, but the misinformed and fake clues offer plausible distractions, requiring careful consideration of the distinctions between the choices. This strikes a good balance for a game.",The informed clues are strong and specific. The fake clues effectively target 'Reptiles' and 'Amphibians'.

The intersection is very broad.",5,"These clues are highly effective misdirections. The first clue ('long, flexible body,' 'slither,' 'crawl') strongly points to snakes, which are not among the choices but could be a plausible misdirection if snakes were a choice. The second clue ('streamlined bodies,' 'fins') clearly points to fish. The third clue ('fly,' 'build nests') points to birds. These are all well-crafted to lead players away from the correct answer and towards entirely different categories of animals, making them excellent fake clues.",,3,"The informed clues are quite specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to pinpoint once understood. The misinformed clues are vague but don't offer enough distinct overlap to cause significant confusion on their own. The fake clues are very strong misdirections, but the overall difficulty is balanced by the highly specific informed clues. It's a moderate challenge.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the answer 'crabs'.
