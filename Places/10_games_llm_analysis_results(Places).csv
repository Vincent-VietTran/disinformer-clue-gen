1,Places,1,Natural Feature,"Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site",5,"The clues are highly specific to natural features, using descriptive language about geological processes, biodiversity, and outdoor activities. They avoid any terms that could be mistaken for urban landmarks or historical sites. The clues cover diverse aspects of natural features.",1,"These clues are too specific and only apply to the correct answer ('Natural Feature'). For example, 'These places are frequently visited by people who want to explore and discover the world's beauty' is true for natural features but also for urban landmarks and historical sites. However, the second clue, 'Many of these places are popular destinations for tourism and are often captured in photographs and films,' is also true for urban landmarks and historical sites. The problem is that these clues are not *maximally* ambiguous. They don't fully intersect with *all* incorrect answers in a way that creates productive confusion. They are too close to being informed clues.",5,"These clues are excellent examples of fake clues. They directly and plausibly describe 'Urban Landmark' and 'Historical Site' respectively, using terms like 'cities,' 'architectural significance,' 'historical importance,' 'commemorate significant occasions,' and 'prominent individuals.' They completely avoid any connection to the correct answer, 'Natural Feature,' thus providing strong misdirection.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer quite clear if one focuses on them. However, the misinformed clues, while weak, attempt to create some ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirection. The overall balance of strong informed and fake clues with weak misinformed clues creates a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent and highly specific to the correct answer. The fake clues are also very effective, strongly pointing to incorrect answers. The misinformed clues need significant improvement; they are not ambiguous enough and do not share truth with all incorrect answers as required. They are too close to being informed clues. The difficulty is moderate due to the strong informed and fake clues counteracting the weak misinformed clues.",14,14,100%,15.9
1,Places,2,Grand Canyon,"Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, Great Barrier Reef",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive of the Grand Canyon, using terms like 'immense scale,' 'vibrant layers of rock,' 'geological time,' 'immense chasm,' 'tapestry of rock layers,' 'Earth's long and dynamic history,' 'breathtaking vistas,' 'majestic view of the landscape,' 'diverse ecosystems,' 'erosion by a mighty river,' 'major destination for adventurers and explorers,' 'stunning views,' 'geological formations,' and 'hiking trails.' None of these terms could plausibly apply to Niagara Falls or the Great Barrier Reef.",1,"The misinformed clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers. 'Popular destination for tourists' and 'beautiful scenery' are true for all three options (Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, Great Barrier Reef). However, the clues are so general that they offer no productive ambiguity and are essentially useless for the game's purpose.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to Niagara Falls. 'Cascading water' is a defining characteristic of Niagara Falls and completely irrelevant to the Grand Canyon or the Great Barrier Reef. The second fake clue, 'unique rock formations,' could be argued to apply to the Grand Canyon, but the primary focus on 'rock formations' without the geological context makes it lean towards a more general interpretation or could be misconstrued as the unique coral formations of the Great Barrier Reef, but the 'cascading water' clue strongly points to Niagara.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer. The misinformed clues are too vague to be helpful or harmful, and the fake clues are highly misleading towards one incorrect answer.",The informed clues are excellent and precisely target the Grand Canyon. The misinformed clues are too general and fail to create ambiguity. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting to Niagara Falls.,14,14,100%,17.7
2,Places,1,Landmark,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",4,"Clues are descriptive and avoid direct synonyms of the answer. They cover various aspects like recognition, symbolism, tourism, origin, media representation, protection, historical/cultural significance, and educational value. Some clues lean slightly towards being too specific to 'Landmark' without being overly obvious.",3,"These clues are factually true for all options (Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins) as they are all places visited by many people and found in diverse locations. However, they lack the specificity to create productive ambiguity; they are almost too general and don't strongly suggest any specific option over others, making them less effective at generating confusion.",5,These clues are highly effective at misdirecting towards 'Ancient ruins' or potentially 'Monument'. The idea of being 'buried for centuries' strongly points away from 'Landmark' which can be contemporary and above ground. 'Created to celebrate a specific person or event' also leans more towards 'Monument' or historical 'Ancient ruins' rather than the broader concept of a 'Landmark'.,,3,"The 'Informed' clues provide good, distinct information about the correct answer without being too easy. The 'Misinformed' clues are a bit too general, and the 'Fake' clues are quite effective at misdirection. This combination creates a moderate level of difficulty.","The 'Informed' clues are well-crafted and provide solid information about 'Landmark'. The 'Misinformed' clues are factually correct for all options but lack the nuance for productive ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are excellent at misdirecting towards incorrect answers, particularly 'Ancient ruins'.",14,14,100%,16.1
2,Places,2,Mount Everest,"Mount Everest, Fuji Mountain, Fansipan Mountain",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, effectively pointing to Mount Everest without using any direct or synonymous terms. They cover various aspects like geography, origin, and environmental factors, ensuring a strong connection to the correct answer.",2,"These clues are too vague. While technically true for Mount Everest, they are also overwhelmingly true for Fuji Mountain and Fansipan Mountain, which are also natural attractions with scenery and unique landscapes. They don't create productive ambiguity because they are so broadly applicable to all choices.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting the player towards a location with historical structures and monuments, which is not characteristic of any of the mountain choices. They strongly suggest a historical site, making them excellent deceptive clues.",,4,"The strong 'Informed' clues make the correct answer discoverable, but the 'Misinformed' clues are too broad and the 'Fake' clues are very deceptive, requiring careful consideration of the nuances. This balance leads to a higher difficulty.","The 'Informed' clues are excellent, providing specific details without revealing the answer. The 'Misinformed' clues are too generic and could be improved to offer more targeted ambiguity. The 'Fake' clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to non-mountainous historical sites.",14,14,100%,15.9
3,Places,1,Ancient ruins,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",4,Clues are descriptive and avoid direct synonyms. They focus on the historical and cultural aspects of ancient ruins well. Some clues could be slightly more varied in their descriptive angles.,2,"The misinformed clues are too general and do not create sufficient ambiguity. 'Places that have been around for a very long time' and 'related to the history of a place' could apply to landmarks and monuments much more strongly than ancient ruins, failing the requirement to be true for all choices. They are not productively ambiguous.",5,"The fake clues effectively misdirect. The first clue strongly points to 'Landmark' (places people go to relax, escape the hustle). The second clue strongly points to 'Monument' (man-made structures honoring individuals or commemorating moments). Neither clue relates to 'Ancient ruins'.",,3,"The informed clues are good and specific enough to guide towards the correct answer. The fake clues are strong misdirections. The weak misinformed clues prevent the puzzle from being too easy, but the strong fake clues and good informed clues make it a balanced difficulty.","The informed clues are well-crafted and descriptive. The fake clues are excellent misdirections. The misinformed clues are the weakest part, being too general and not truly applying to all options as required for productive ambiguity. This makes the puzzle lean towards being solvable by eliminating the fake options and identifying the specific nature of the informed clues.",15,15,100%,16.3
3,Places,2,Pyramids of Giza,"Machu Picchu, Stonehenge, Pyramids of Giza",4,"The clues are quite specific and accurately describe the Pyramids of Giza. They focus on aspects like purpose, symbolism, location, construction, and historical significance. There's good coverage of different angles. One minor point is the phrase 'in the sands of the desert' could be seen as slightly too direct, but overall it's strong.",3,"These clues are factually true for all three locations, as they are all old, historically significant, and highly visited. However, they are very general and don't create much 'productive ambiguity' as they are almost universally applicable to any major ancient wonder. The ambiguity is present, but not particularly engaging or thought-provoking.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. The first clue strongly points to Machu Picchu ('high in the mountains', 'intricate stonework'). The second clue directly targets Stonehenge ('circular arrangement of stones', 'celestial events'). They are plausible and avoid any connection to the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to lead a player to the correct answer, but the fake clues offer significant misdirection towards incorrect options, requiring careful consideration. The misinformed clues add a layer of generality that doesn't help or hinder too much. This balance makes it a medium difficulty.",A well-constructed set of clues. The informed clues are descriptive and accurate. The fake clues are highly effective at misdirecting players to specific incorrect choices. The misinformed clues are factually sound for all options but lack the sharpness to be truly productive in creating ambiguity.,15,15,100%,16.3
4,Places,1,Monument,"Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins",4,Clues are quite descriptive and specific to the answer. They avoid direct synonyms but clearly point to monuments without being overly broad. Some clues could be slightly more varied in their descriptive angle.,3,"These clues are too general and are factually true for all options (Landmark, Monument, Ancient ruins). They don't create productive ambiguity because they don't offer any distinguishing features, making them equally applicable to all choices without differentiation. They are not specific enough to be 'informed' but also not specific enough to be truly misleading.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. The first clue about battles strongly points to 'Ancient ruins' or potentially a specific type of 'Landmark', while the second clue about nature points strongly to 'Landmark' or 'Ancient ruins'. Neither clue relates to 'Monument' specifically.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are specific enough to guide towards the correct answer for someone familiar with the term. The 'fake' clues are strong distractors, and the 'misinformed' clues are too vague to be useful. This balance creates a moderate difficulty.","The informed clues are good, specific, and avoid answer contamination. The fake clues are excellent distractors. The misinformed clues are too generic and don't effectively create ambiguity between the options; they are equally true for all but offer no distinguishing information.",15,15,100%,16.7
4,Places,2,Taj Mahal,"Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty",5,"The clues are highly specific and descriptive, clearly pointing to the Taj Mahal without using any forbidden words or synonyms. They cover various aspects like its purpose, material, architectural style, and historical context.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For instance, 'This place is an iconic structure, drawing many tourists from around the world to visit it every year' is true for the Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower, but not necessarily the Statue of Liberty (which is more of a monument than a tourist destination in the same vein). The goal is shared truth across *all* options, which these fail to achieve.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. They directly and accurately describe the Statue of Liberty ('tall structure...symbol of freedom, standing in a harbor') and the Eiffel Tower ('very tall structure, famous for the views it offers'). They completely avoid any connection to the Taj Mahal.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong, making it relatively easy to identify the Taj Mahal. However, the fake clues are highly effective misdirection towards the Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty, increasing the overall challenge. The misinformed clues are poorly constructed and do not add to the difficulty in a productive way.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The misinformed clues, however, fail to meet the core requirements of the game, being too specific and not universally applicable to all incorrect choices. This significantly impacts the overall quality and intended difficulty.",15,15,100%,16.9
5,Places,1,Country,"Country, Continent, Region",5,"The clues are precise and avoid any direct mention or synonym of 'Country'. They highlight key attributes like defined boundaries, government oversight, political entity, recognized sovereignty, and distinct culture, all of which strongly point to 'Country' without contamination.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not create productive ambiguity. While factually true for 'Country', they are also true for 'Region' and 'Continent' in a very general sense. However, they lack any specific elements that would make them plausibly point to any of the incorrect answers over the correct one, making them too weak for the purpose of misdirection.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting. They strongly and plausibly describe 'Continent' by using terms like 'vast geographical area', 'comprising multiple nations', and 'expansive landmass', while completely avoiding any characteristics of a 'Country'.",,4,"The informed clues are strong and specific to the answer, while the fake clues are very strong misdirectors towards 'Continent'. The misinformed clues are weak, which might make the game slightly easier than intended if the player focuses on them. However, the strength of the informed and fake clues creates a good challenge.","The informed clues are excellent, providing clear definitions without using forbidden words. The fake clues are very well-crafted to target 'Continent'. The misinformed clues are the weakest aspect, being too general and not creating enough ambiguity. The overall difficulty is good, leaning towards challenging due to the strong misdirection.",14,14,100%,15.6
5,Places,2,China,"China, Japan, India",5,"The clues are highly specific to China, using iconic landmarks (Great Wall), population size, historical significance, economic growth, and cultural depth. They avoid any overlap with Japan or India. The paraphrasing is effective.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the critical requirement of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers (Japan, India). For example, 'unique culture and traditions' is true for all three, but 'large population' is more strongly associated with China and India than Japan. They do not create productive ambiguity because they aren't equally true for all options.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to Japan. 'Cherry blossoms', 'ancient temples', 'delicious sushi cuisine', 'technological advancements', 'distinct anime', and 'unique cultural characteristics' are all strongly associated with Japan and not with China or India, making them excellent deceptive clues.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to lead to the correct answer, while the fake clues provide significant misdirection. The misinformed clues are weak, which slightly lowers the overall challenge, but the balance of strong informed and fake clues makes it a moderately challenging game.",The informed clues are excellent and specific to the answer. The fake clues are very effective at misdirecting to Japan. The misinformed clues are too weak and do not meet the criteria for productive ambiguity as they are not equally true for all incorrect options. The difficulty is appropriate for a game that aims for a balanced challenge.,14,14,100%,16.0
6,Places,1,Continent,"Country, Continent, Region",4,The clues are generally good and descriptive of 'Continent'. They avoid direct synonyms but do use words like 'landmasses' and 'geographic division' which are very close. The clues are distinct enough and avoid answer contamination.,3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all options (Country, Continent, Region). They are quite general ('territories on Earth with a population, government, and defined borders' and 'geographic areas that are home to people, animals, and plants'). This creates productive ambiguity as they could apply to any of the choices.",4,"The fake clues strongly point to 'Country' by mentioning 'political entity', 'sovereignty', 'government, laws', and 'national identity'. They are factually true for 'Country' but not for 'Continent' or 'Region', effectively misdirecting away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are quite specific to 'Continent', making it somewhat easy to identify. However, the misinformed clues are general enough to create some pause, and the fake clues are good at misdirection. This balances out to a moderate difficulty.",The informed clues are well-written and descriptive of 'Continent'. The misinformed clues successfully create ambiguity by being true for all options. The fake clues are effective in misdirecting towards 'Country'. The difficulty is appropriate for a game setting.,15,15,100%,15.9
6,Places,2,Asia,"Africa, Asia, Europe",5,"The clues are specific and descriptive, clearly pointing to Asia without using any forbidden words. They highlight population, historical sites, trade influence, climate diversity, and ancient civilizations.",1,These clues are far too general and do not meet the criteria of being factually true for ALL incorrect answers (Africa and Europe). They are not ambiguous enough to be effective misinformed clues.,5,"These clues are excellent for misdirection. The first points strongly to Africa (lions, elephants, savannahs), and the second points strongly to Europe (Roman, Greek empires). They effectively steer players away from Asia.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide towards the correct answer, while the fake clues provide good misdirection. The misinformed clues are too weak to significantly impact difficulty.",The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. The misinformed clues need significant revision to meet the game's criteria.,14,14,100%,16.4
7,Places,1,State,"State, City, District",4,"The clues are descriptive and avoid answer words. They capture the essence of a 'State' as a political and geographical entity with its own governance, differentiating it from a city or district. Some clues could be slightly more distinct in their focus.",3,"These clues are factually true for State, City, and District, creating ambiguity. They focus on the shared characteristic of being populated areas with infrastructure. The ambiguity is productive but could be slightly more nuanced to avoid being too generic.",5,"These clues strongly point towards 'City' by mentioning bustling areas, buildings, businesses, skyscrapers, and public transportation, effectively misdirecting away from 'State'. They are plausible descriptions of a city and completely unrelated to the core definition of a state.",,3,"The informed clues are good, and the fake clues are effective misdirection. The misinformed clues are appropriately ambiguous. This combination should provide a balanced challenge.","The set of clues effectively targets 'State' with informed and fake clues. The misinformed clues are general enough to apply to all options, creating the intended ambiguity. The fake clues are particularly strong in their misdirection towards 'City'.",15,15,100%,15.8
7,Places,2,Victoria,"Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland",4,"The clues are descriptive and specific to Victoria. There is some overlap in the general themes (culture, economy, landmarks) but they are generally well-differentiated by the specific examples or emphasis.",1,"These clues are not factually true for all choices. For example, 'This place is located in a country that is known for its unique wildlife and beautiful landscapes' is true for Australia as a whole, but not necessarily specific enough to be true for all Australian states. The second clue is also too general and doesn't hold true for all incorrect options.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to other Australian states. 'Tropical climate, lush rainforests, and beautiful beaches' strongly points to Queensland, and 'outback, with vast deserts, unique wildlife, and Indigenous culture' strongly points to New South Wales or other more arid parts of Australia.",,4,"The informed clues are strong enough to point to Victoria, but the highly effective fake clues create significant misdirection, making it challenging. The misinformed clues are weak and don't contribute to difficulty.","The informed clues are good, but the fake clues are exceptionally strong and effectively misdirect the player. The misinformed clues are poorly constructed and fail to meet the criteria for ambiguity.",15,15,100%,16.1
8,Places,1,City,"State, City, District",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'City' without using the word itself or direct synonyms. They describe key characteristics like density, infrastructure, culture, and economic activity that are strongly indicative of a city. The clues avoid any overlap with 'State' or 'District'.",1,"These clues are too vague and overly general. While factually true for 'City', they are also equally true for 'State' and 'District' in a very broad sense, offering almost no distinguishing information. The ambiguity is not productive; it's simply a lack of distinguishing features. For example, 'large population, with many different people living in close proximity together' is true for all three in varying degrees. 'Wide variety of public services' is also applicable to all.",5,"These clues are excellent at misdirection. 'Distinct borders, often governed by a specific set of laws and regulations' strongly points to 'State' or 'District' and away from 'City' (as cities are often within states/districts with their own governance). 'Less populated than other areas, offering more open spaces' clearly targets 'District' or potentially a rural 'State' and is the opposite of 'City'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong, but the misinformed clues are too weak, making it easier to deduce the answer. The fake clues are effective at misdirection, which adds some difficulty, but the overall balance leans towards easier due to the poor misinformed clues.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and serve their intended purposes effectively. However, the misinformed clues fail to create productive ambiguity, being too general and not truly shared by all options. This significantly lowers the overall quality of the misinformed section and the game's difficulty.",15,15,100%,16.0
8,Places,2,Hanoi,"Hanoi, Canberra, Washington, D.C.",4,"Clues are quite specific to Hanoi, using descriptive language that avoids direct answer words. They cover various aspects like culture, architecture, food, and history, providing a good profile. Minor improvement could be made by ensuring even more distinct angles, but overall strong.",2,"The misinformed clues are too generic. While factually true for Hanoi, they are also very likely true for Washington D.C. and potentially Canberra to some extent, but lack the specificity to create productive ambiguity. They don't strongly point to incorrect answers without also strongly pointing to the correct one.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. The first strongly suggests Washington D.C. ('iconic monuments and memorial buildings, celebrating past leaders and events'). The second strongly suggests Canberra ('planned city, with a design that emphasizes order and the importance of nature and parks'). They are plausible but completely unrelated to Hanoi.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to lead to the correct answer for someone familiar with the locations. The fake clues provide significant misdirection, making the game challenging. The misinformed clues are weak, which slightly lowers the overall difficulty of creating confusion.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted, providing good information for the correct answer and strong misdirection to incorrect ones, respectively. The misinformed clues could be improved to create more effective ambiguity. The overall balance is good for a moderate difficulty game.",15,15,100%,16.9
9,Places,1,Commercial,"Commercial, Industrial, Residential",5,"All clues are highly specific and descriptive of commercial areas without using the answer word or its direct synonyms. They cover various aspects like types of establishments, purpose, and customer interaction.",1,"These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'encounter other people and engage in activities' is very weakly true for Industrial and Residential areas compared to Commercial. They are not productively ambiguous and fail the core requirement of shared truth across all options.",5,"These clues are excellent. They directly and accurately describe 'Industrial' and 'Residential' zones, providing strong misdirection away from 'Commercial' without any overlap.",,2,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer quite clear. The fake clues are also very distinct. The misinformed clues are too weak to provide any real confusion, lowering the overall difficulty.","The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and adhere to the rules. The misinformed clues fail to meet the essential criteria of being true for all incorrect options, making them ineffective. This leads to a lower overall difficulty.",14,14,100%,17.1
9,Places,2,Chadstone,"Chadstone, West Edmonton Mall, The Dubai Mall",5,"Clues are specific and accurately describe Chadstone without using direct answer words. They highlight its size, location, retail offerings, and status as a major destination.",3,"The misinformed clues are factually true for all three options (shopping malls are popular gathering spots and visited by many people). They create ambiguity but are quite general, not specifically productive for this set of choices.",5,"These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first clue strongly points to West Edmonton Mall (ski slope, amusement park) and the second to The Dubai Mall (grand architecture, city skyline views). They are completely unrelated to Chadstone.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to point to the correct answer, but the presence of effective fake clues that strongly point to incorrect answers, combined with general misinformed clues, creates a balanced challenge.","The informed clues are excellent, providing specific details about Chadstone.

10,Places,1,Historical Site,"Natural Feature, Urban Landmark, Historical Site",5,"The clues are highly specific to 'Historical Site' without using direct keywords. They focus on tangible links to the past, preservation, educational aspects, and significant events, which are defining characteristics of historical sites. The clues offer distinct angles on the concept.",2,"The misinformed clues are too vague and do not create sufficient ambiguity. While 'frequented by many people' and 'popular with tourists' can be true for historical sites, they are also very strongly true for Urban Landmarks and to a lesser extent Natural Features. They don't effectively bridge the gap to Natural Feature or Urban Landmark in a way that is equally applicable to all incorrect options. They are more of a weak overlap than strong shared truth.",5,"The fake clues are excellent. 'Formed through geological processes, often displaying unique, awe-inspiring, and naturally beautiful landscapes' is a perfect description for 'Natural Feature'. 'Typically bustling hubs, providing residents with essential daily services and necessary amenities for life' is a very strong description for 'Urban Landmark'. These clues strongly and plausibly point to the incorrect answers while being completely unrelated to 'Historical Site'.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making the correct answer relatively easy to deduce for someone familiar with the concepts. However, the fake clues are exceptionally strong and well-crafted, creating significant misdirection towards 'Natural Feature' and 'Urban Landmark'. This strong misdirection, combined with the highly specific informed clues, creates a challenging game where players must carefully weigh the precise nature of the informed clues against the deceptive allure of the fake ones. The misinformed clues are weak, which slightly reduces the overall ambiguity but the strength of the fake clues compensates for this.","The informed clues are excellent, providing precise and varied descriptions of 'Historical Site' without using forbidden terms. The fake clues are outstanding, offering highly plausible and descriptive definitions for 'Natural Feature' and 'Urban Landmark', thereby creating strong misdirection.

For example, 'cultural significance and beauty' is true for all three, but 'major tourist attraction' is also true for all three. However, the clue about 'cultural significance and beauty' is not specific enough to be useful. The prompt requires that misinformed clues be true for *all* incorrect answers as well as the correct answer, which is extremely difficult to achieve and often leads to overly generic statements.
