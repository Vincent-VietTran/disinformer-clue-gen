**Compliance Rate:** 100% (14/14 clues)  
**Outliers:** 0/14 clues failed  
**Average Word Count:** 17.1 words

**Assessment:** ✅ Acceptable - Most clues meet length requirements

---

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

All clues are highly specific and descriptive of commercial areas without using the answer word or its direct synonyms. They cover various aspects like types of establishments, purpose, and customer interaction.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 1/5  
**Poor - Needs significant revision**

These clues are too vague and do not meet the criteria of being true for ALL incorrect answers. For example, 'encounter other people and engage in activities' is very weakly true for Industrial and Residential areas compared to Commercial. They are not productively ambiguous and fail the core requirement of shared truth across all options.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are excellent. They directly and accurately describe 'Industrial' and 'Residential' zones, providing strong misdirection away from 'Commercial' without any overlap.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

**Main Issues:**
- Minor issues noted

1. Minor length adjustments

The informed and fake clues are well-crafted and adhere to the rules. The misinformed clues fail to meet the essential criteria of being true for all incorrect options, making them ineffective. This leads to a lower overall difficulty.

## 2. Quality Scores (Rate 1-5)

### Informed Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

Clues are specific and accurately describe Chadstone without using direct answer words. They highlight its size, location, retail offerings, and status as a major destination.

✅ Strengths:
- Generally specific and relate to correct answer
- Provide distinct perspectives where applicable

⚠️ Concerns:
- Minor thematic overlap observed

### Misinformed Clues: 3/5  
**Good - Meets requirements**

The misinformed clues are factually true for all three options (shopping malls are popular gathering spots and visited by many people). They create ambiguity but are quite general, not specifically productive for this set of choices.

✅ Strengths:
- Attempt to create ambiguity
- Generally related to the correct answer

⚠️ Concerns:
- May need more subtle misdirection
- Ambiguity effectiveness varies

### Fake Clues: 5/5  
**Excellent - Outstanding**

These clues are highly effective at misdirecting to the incorrect answers. The first clue strongly points to West Edmonton Mall (ski slope, amusement park) and the second to The Dubai Mall (grand architecture, city skyline views). They are completely unrelated to Chadstone.

✅ Strengths:
- Effectively misdirect to wrong answer choices
- Clear deception without being obvious

- Insufficient ambiguity in misinformed clues

**Priority Actions:**
1. Minor length adjustments
2. Maintain misinformed clue quality
3. Maintain current diversity

**Overall Notes:**  
The informed clues are excellent, providing specific details about Chadstone. The fake clues are very strong and effectively misdirect to the incorrect options. The misinformed clues are factually correct for all options but lack specific productive ambiguity for this particular set.
