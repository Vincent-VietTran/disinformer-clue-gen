The first clue strongly points to 'Sci-Fi' by mentioning advanced technology and space travel, while the second clue plausibly describes an 'Adventure' or 'Sci-Fi' scenario with survival and perilous conditions. Neither clue has any direct factual overlap with 'Fantasy'.",,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer clear if one understands the genre.

They clearly and accurately point to the correct answer.",2,The clues are too vague and could apply to many stories involving young protagonists on journeys or discovering themselves. They do not create productive ambiguity as they are so general they could apply to almost any fictional narrative with a central character. The 'universal intersection' is extremely weak.,5,The fake clues are highly effective. They directly and accurately describe the incorrect choices ('Dune' and 'The Hobbit') using specific details without any overlap with the correct answer. This provides strong misdirection.,,3,"The informed clues are very strong, making the correct answer easily identifiable for those familiar with the book. However, the misinformed clues are so generic that they don't offer much in the way of challenge or confusion, while the fake clues are highly effective misdirectors.

2,Books,1,Mystery,"Mystery, Thriller, Crime",5,"The clues are highly specific to the core elements of a mystery, using precise language like 'puzzle that needs to be solved', 'investigation and deduction', 'secrets and hidden knowledge', and 'seeking answers to a mystery'. They effectively avoid answer contamination and cover distinct angles of the genre.",3,"The clues are factually true for all options, focusing on general elements like suspense, thrills, unknown, human experiences, emotions, and relationships.

'Psychological states' and 'inner thoughts and feelings' also lean towards 'Thriller' and 'Crime' over 'Mystery'. They are completely unrelated to the core of 'Mystery'.",,3,"The informed clues are strong and specific, while the fake clues are very effective misdirectors.

The score reflects the precise and distinct nature of these clues for the correct answer.",3,"These clues are very general and could apply to almost any narrative.

Similarly, 'The story's narrative explores a human experience, which features a cast of characters, and a setting' is also universally true. They provide minimal ambiguity, leaning towards being too vague rather than productively confusing.",5,"These clues are excellent misdirection. 'The story's narrative portrays a detective working to solve a series of murders, with a focus on clues' strongly points to 'Sherlock Holmes' without being explicitly about him. 'The narrative focuses on a detective solving a complex case and facing personal challenges along the way' also aligns well with the general idea of detective fiction, making 'Sherlock Holmes' a plausible incorrect choice. They effectively avoid any overlap with 'The Da Vinci Code'.",,3,"The 'informed' clues are very strong and specific to the correct answer, making it relatively easy to identify.

The clues offer distinct angles on the genre's focus.",2,"These clues are too general.

They don't offer enough distinct ambiguity to be truly misleading between the options.",5,"The fake clues are highly effective. 'The story centers on a daring rescue mission with a team facing perilous conditions and impossible odds' strongly points to 'Suspense' (especially given the common trope of rescue thrillers). 'This genre commonly utilizes paranormal elements, such as ghosts, demons, and other unexplainable, supernatural phenomena' points directly to 'Mystery' if interpreted as supernatural mysteries, or potentially a subgenre of suspense, but it's very unlikely to be associated with 'Thriller'.",,4,"The informed clues are very strong and specific, making it easy to identify the correct answer. However, the misinformed clues are too broad, and the fake clues are very targeted towards the incorrect answers, creating a good level of challenge in distinguishing between the subtle nuances and avoiding the misdirection.","The informed clues are excellent and accurately pinpoint 'Thriller'.

They are plausible and avoid any overlap with the correct answer.",,3,"The 'Informed' clues are very strong and specific, making it relatively easy to identify the correct answer. However, the 'Misinformed' clues provide just enough shared truth to create a slight pause, and the 'Fake' clues are well-crafted to pull players towards incorrect answers, offering a balanced challenge.","The 'Informed' clues are exceptionally well-crafted for specificity.

The clues are distinct and offer multiple angles to identify the correct answer.",3,"The clues are factually true for all options, creating ambiguity. However, they are on the vaguer side and could be slightly more specific while still maintaining ambiguity to be more productively confusing. For instance, the second clue could be slightly more tailored to the shared themes without giving away too much.",4,"These clues are designed to strongly point towards 'The Nightingale' and 'All the Light We Cannot See' by focusing on generational sagas, self-discovery, and cultural heritage, which are less central to 'The Book Thief'. They effectively misdirect away from the correct answer.",,3,"The informed clues are strong enough to guide a player towards the correct answer, while the misinformed and fake clues provide plausible distractions. The balance between specific, unique clues and general, misleading ones creates a moderate level of difficulty.","The informed clues are excellent, providing specific details without revealing the answer.
